        <p>
          In these latter days, we have observed the <abbr>moti√µ</abbr> of celestial
          bodies with greater accuracy. The <abbr>co$cerning</abbr> matter of planetary
          orbits has been much debated among the <abbr>lear$ed</abbr> men of our age.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <abbr>iudgme$t</abbr> of Copernicus, though controversial, has found 
          <abbr>substa$tial</abbr> support among those who study the heavens.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we <abbr>co$sider</abbr> the evidence before us, the <abbr>argume$ts</abbr>
          for a heliocentric system become difficult to dismiss.

        <head>On the <abbr>Natu$</abbr> of Light</head>
        <p>
          The properties of light have been <abbr>demo$strated</abbr> through various
          experiments. We know that light travels in straight lines, and that it can be
          reflected and refracted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some have <abbr>mai$tained</abbr> that light consists of tiny particles, while
          others have argued for a wave-like <abbr>natu$</abbr>.
