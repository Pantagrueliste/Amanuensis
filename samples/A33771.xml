            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

As I would do my Country that honour and right, not without reaſon to compare her and her Gardens with the moſt eminent Countrys and Gardens in the World, ſo I ſhall leſſe trouble the Reader with thoſe Outlandiſh Plants and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, which are almoſt if not altogether impoſſible to be obtained, but rather acquaint him with thoſe more whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Heros and Plants that he hath growing at his own doore, which are more conſonant and proper for his Body.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though their <hi>Cutts</hi> do take up much roome and render their Books much more abundantly deare, yet they are ſo much inferior to thoſe of <hi>Matthiolus</hi> and <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb facs="tcp:52711:4"/> of the ſmallneſſe of their Size, and the falſe placing of them, that the Botanick is as commonly puzzled as ſatisfied, and thereby diſabled to give an ingenious account of them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As many things have ſince their Deaths been obſerved in Gardens and other places which they never diſcourſed of, ſo there are many vertues ſince diſcovered in Plants which they never ſo much as mentioned.</p>

            <p n="7">7. I have not altogether walked alone in theſe my Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes but have gone along with <hi>Mr. Steevens</hi> Principall of <hi>Hart-Hall</hi> in <hi>Oxford, Mr. Lydall, Mr. Brown, Mr. Wit, Mr. Hanley, Mr. Beeſton, Mr. John Croſſe,</hi> the Apothecary, and divers other my good Friends, being very eminent Botanicks, in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> converſed with and received advice from them, and had the approbation of divers other learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Herbariſts now living, and if I have failed of the beſt of our Engliſh men, <hi>Mr. Good-yeare, Dr. Bowle, Mr. Aſhmole,</hi> the intelligence of our late times, Dr. <hi>How,</hi> their aſſiſtance had not been wanting to mine endeavour, if my humble deſerts could have raiſed me to the felicity and Honour of their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.</p>
            <p n="8">8. I have not only ſet the Names of Plants and their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues but their proprieties alſo, their Affects and Effects, their Increaſe and Decreaſe, their Flouriſhing and Fading; their diſtinct Varieties and ſeveral qualities, ſo that I may reſolve the Reader thus much, that though no Art be able to expreſſe Nature in her likeneſſe, yet if any Author can with his Pen counterfeit Similitude for Life, ſhape and ſhaddowes for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, he doth to the utmoſt of his power expreſſe his Duty.</p>
            <p>I hope I ſhall not need any motives to encourage the green Herbariſt to this ſtudy. If Pleaſures may invite him, what fairer objects are there for the ſight then theſe painted Brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries? what Odours can raviſh the ſenſe of ſmelling more then thoſe of flowers? If the ſenſuality of the Taſte hath delighted him, what can be more acceptable then the luxurious delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Fruits: And for that high concernment we all ſeek after, Health, what hath the great preſerver of all things rendered more ſoveraigne then the vertues of Herbs and Plants, without the uſe of ſome of which no Confection can be made by the Apothecary. If none of theſe melting inducements carry force enough with them, the Reader muſt give me leave
<pb facs="tcp:52711:5"/> to deſcend to the great argument of the World, <hi>Profit,</hi> which, above the general good, hath been a Bait that hath caught the vulgar: In the firſt Age, as Herbs and Fruits were the ordinary Meat of Men, ſo the neceſſary uſe and benefit of them is the more clearly evidenced unto us, both by the long and health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Lives of our Fore-Fathers, and alſo by the great paines and charges, they from time to time were at in manuring and planting Orchards and Gardens, making uſe and gaine of Wilder places, not only delighting themſelves with ſome of the Ornamentall Toyes of Nature, but proſequuting the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of their Lives for the neerer concernment of Proviſion for their Families.</p>
            <p>And now, ingenuous Reader, that I may ſhew my ſelfe as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere an honourer and true lover of the advancement of this Science as I can, give me leave moſt heartily to wiſh that there were more Benefactors to the late noble Inſtitutions of ſome Phyſick-Gardens: amongſt which Mr. <hi>Morgan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In which induſtry I have not been alone, but have found ſuch loving freinds, both Phyſitians, Chirurgions, and other Coadjutors and Travellers with me in this Science alſo, that I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I may modeſtly affirme that I have done that, which no Engliſh man hath preceded mee in.</p>
            <p>And beſides this generall Method of the whole Book, you will find that of every particular Chapter to treat of the Names, Kinds, Formes, Places, and Time, Temperatures and Vertues, if not the Signature of every Plant. For not doubting but it will come into the Hands of ſome Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Perſons, whoſe longing deſire it is, to be expert in this moſt ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry imployment, I have omitted nothing that might render it incompleat, beginning with the Names which are moſt commonly given them either for their moſt eminent vertues, or for ſome notable affection, or elſe for dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference ſake; that the diverſity of Names, that the beſt Writers attribute<note place="margin">Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt rebus nomina ſaepè ſuis.</note> to the ſame thing, might partly be made known. For to ſet down thoſe improper, baſtard, and inſignificant names, which are uſed in divers Counties of this Land, and amongſt ſome Writers alſo, would require much pains to little Purpoſe. And then, that that great Variety wherein Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath been pleaſed to diſcover her Beauty and Liberality, might not be concealed, I have ſet down moſt of the Species of every Genus. As for the Forms, I have uſually deſcribed that which is moſt ordinary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Providence hath prudently ordered that thoſe things which are moſt common, ſhould be likewiſe moſt uſefull, though there be ſome phantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ones that eſteeme lightly of every thing which is not rare. The Places<note place="margin">Omne cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, rarum</note> are alſo many times particularly expreſſed, that the Reader may know to obtaine thoſe Plants he ſtandeth indeed of; And that he may not look for them at a ſeaſon, that they are not to be had, the Time is expreſſed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and ſometimes, the particular time, of gathering.</p>

Laſtly, that nothing might be wanting that can be thought neceſſary for the Complement of this my well meaning deſigne, beſides the Table of Appropriations which is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed, there is ſuffixed or ſet after it a threefold Index or Table, one of the Latine, and another of the Engliſh Names, with a Table of the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Properties, whereby divers Inquiries, whether Medicinall or other may be fully ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>And now let me tell the ingenious Reader, and by him others, that if thoſe of theſe times would but be, by a joynt Concurrence, as induſtrious to ſearch into the ſecrets of the Nature of Herbs, as ſome of the former, and make tryall of them as they did, they ſhould no doubt find the force of Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples many times no leſse effectuall, then that of Compounds, to which this preſent Age is too too much addicted, as hath been very well obſerved by thoſe learned Brethren of that noble Order of the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The <hi>Wall-nut</hi> is a luſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tree both for height and bulk, and ſpreadeth forth many large Arms and Boughs, and muſt make a goodly ſhadow, when the leaves are on, which conſiſt of five or ſix faſtned to one rib, with one ſtanding on the top, like thoſe of the Aſh, but that they are much larger: the bark is ſomewhat green in the younger boughs; but in the Trunk, it is tending to the colour of Aſhes, and is full of clefts for the moſt part; It beareth Catkins or Aglets, which come forth before the Nuts, of a yellowiſh colour, which open into ſmall flowers, and falling away, the round Nuts come in their places, two or three u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually ſet together; but ſometimes half a dozen or more, which are covered with a double ſhell; the outermoſt, green, ſoft, thick, of a ſtrong ſmell, the juice co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring black; under which there is a wooddy ſhell, wherein a white ſweet <hi>Kernel</hi> is contained, encloſed with a yellowiſh, bitter peeling, which commeth off eaſily while it is freſh, but will not do ſo when it is old: the inner pulp thereof is white, ſweet, and pleaſant to the taſt, when it is newly gathered, for after it is dry it becommeth oily and rank. Of the whole fruit growing on the Tree, there is this common old Riddle, which almoſt every Child can ſay. Its</p>

It helpeth all cold diſeaſes of the Head, Stomach, Liver, and Belly, with its warming and comforting heat. To cleanſe and comfort the Stomach, and to make a ſweet breath, uſe it in this manner; Take Roſemary with the flowers or without, a handfull or more, ſeeth it in white Wine a good ſpace and put thereto if you pleaſe a little Cinamon, then drink it and waſh your mouth therewith, the ſame without Cinamon maketh the skin very clear; and therefore is good to waſh the hands and face with. It helpeth alſo cold Rheumes falling down into the Eyes, the giddineſſe or ſwimming of the head, the dumb palſie or loſſe of ſpeech, the Lethargy and falling Sickneſſe if it be drunk, and the temples bathed therewith. It is a remedy for the windineſſe in the Stomach or bowells, and expelleth it powerfully, as alſo the Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driack paſſion &amp; wind in the Spleen: it helpeth all thoſe that are Livergrown by opening the obſtructions thereof, by warming the coldneſſe, extenuating the groſſeneſs, and afterwards binding and ſtrengthening the weakneſſe thereof. The Flowers and the Conſerve made of them are ſingular good to comfort the heart, and to expell the Contagion of the Peſtilence, and it is good to burn the branches of it, in infectious times. Both flowers and leaves are very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Women that are troubled with the Whites, if they be daily taken. The dried Leaves being cut and taken in a Tobacco Pipe helpeth them that have any Cough, Tiſſick or Conſumption by warming and drying the thin Diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which cauſe thoſe Diſeaſes. The Chymicall Oyl drawn from the Leaves and flowers is a Soveraign help for all the diſeaſes aforeſaid, if the Temples and Noſtrills be but touched with a drop or two, it helpeth the head and brain, and ſo it doth any cold benummed-Joynt, Sinew, or member, if it be anointed with two or three drops thereof: Great care is to be taken in applying it to inward griefs, for it is very quick and piercing, and therefore but a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is to be taken at once.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>Ordinary Garden Lavender hath a hard wooddy ſtem, parted into many ſmall branches, whereon are ſet whitiſh, long and narrow leaves, by couples one againſt another, from among which, riſe up naked ſquare ſtalks, with two leaves at a joynt; and at the tops, divers ſmall husks ſtanding round about them, formed in long round heads or ſpikes, with blewiſh gaping Flowers, ſpringing out of each of them: the root is wooddy, and ſpreadeth in the ground: the whole Plant is of a ſtrong ſweet ſmell, but eſpecially the heads of Flowers, which are much uſed to be put into linnen and apparel, as alſo into Noſegayes or Poſies, becauſe they are very pleaſing and delightful to the brain, which is much refreſhed with its ſweetneſſe, as on the contrary ſide it is very much offended with evill ſmells. I know not whether it would bear ſeed or not, it being ſo uſually gathered by our Countrey women for the purpoſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, before it come to maturity; and therefore it muſt neceſſarily be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated by ſlips, as Roſemary and Sage uſually is.</p>

                  <p>The firſt Sort is found in the Gardens of moſt Women, that pretend to good huſwifery, who binde it up in bundles, and either carry it to the Market to ſell, or elſe reſerve it for their own uſe; but it, and the ſecond, and third ſort grow naturally in many places of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Narbone</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> from whence they have been tranſlated into the Gardens of thoſe which are curious of all rare Herbs and Plants: as alſo the laſt, which was at the firſt found out by <hi>Cluſius,</hi> both about <hi>Malaca</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Murcia,</hi> in the Realm of <hi>Granado,</hi> and is now to be ſeen in the Phyſick Garden at <hi>Oxon.</hi> In thoſe hotter Countries they flower in <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Lavander</hi> is hot and dry, and that in the third degree, and is of a thin ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, conſiſting of many airy and ſpiritual parts. Therefore it is good to be given any way, againſt the Diſeaſes of the Head, and eſpecially thoſe which have their original or beginning, not of abundance of humors, but chiefly of one quality onely.</p>

                  <head>The Vertues.</head>
                  <p>The diſtilled water of <hi>Lavander</hi> being ſunned for a time, is not onely ſweet of ſmell, and therefore comfortable to the brain; but alſo is good for the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and all other infirmities of the head, proceeding of cold; if the Temples, the hollowneſs under the ears, and the nape of the neck be waſhed therewith: as the Catalepſis, which is a Diſeaſe that taketh away all motion from the body, the Megrim, and the Falling-Sickneſs: yea, two or three ſpoonfuls of the water being drunk, recovereth the ſpeech being loſt, and reviveth them that are in a ſwoun, and ſo it doth, if it be but applyed to the Temples or Noſtrils to be ſmelt unto; but it is not ſafe to uſe it, when the Body is full of humours, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with blood, becauſe of the hot and ſubtill ſpirits, wherewith it is poſſeſſed. A Decoction made with the Flowers of Lavender, Horehound, Fennel, and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragus Roots, and a little Cinamon is very profitably uſed to help the Falling-Sickneſs, and the giddineſs or turning of the brain. Wherefore not without cauſe; the Herb is reckoned of <hi>Schola Salerni,</hi> amongſt thoſe things that cure the Palſie:</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Salvia, Caſtoreumque, Laevandula, Primula Veris.</l>
                     <l>Naſturt. Athanas: haec ſanant Paralytica Membra,</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>That is to ſay, Sage, Caſtory, (that is, the ſtones of the Beaſt, called a Caſtor) Lavender, Primroſe, Watercreſſe, and Tanſie, cure and heal Members infected with the Palſie. So that though the Flowers be of moſt vertue, yet the Herb it ſelf is good for the uſes aforeſaid: as alſo for Apoplexies, Lethargies, Cramps, Convulſions, and gripings of the body proceeding of Cold. It helpeth alſo the ſtopping of the Milt, heateth the belly, and ſendeth down the Terms, and if the ſame be holden often in the mouth, it helpeth the Ulcers and pains of the teeth, and the ſame water is excellent good for bliſters of the mouth, if the mouth be waſhed therewith. It being often ſmelled unto, doth comfort and clear the ſight; and if a ſhirt be but wetted in the water, wherein Lavander hath been boyled, and after dryed, no louſe will breed or abide therein, as long as it keepeth the ſmell. The leſſer Lavander is much commended in all the Diſeaſes of the Mother, as the ſtrangling or ſuffocation, the dislocation or diſplacing, &amp;c. for Women to be bathed therewith, as alſo to help forward their travel. The Chymical Oyl drawn from Lavander, uſually called Oyl of Spike, is good for the Palſie, Falling-Sickneſs, Gouts of the Joynts, and of the feet, both taken at mouth, and alſo anointed; but it muſt be uſed cautiouſly; ſome few drops, being ſufficient to be given with other things, either for inward or outward griefs.</p>

The whole Plant, and every part thereof, is of a moſt pleaſant taſte, and aromatical ſmell, and by transplanting into beds well dreſſed with dry dung, it proſpereth better, and becomes ſo ſtrong, that it is commonly able to abide the coldneſs of the Winter, if it be not extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</p>

The Oyl made thereof is very warming, and comfortable to the joynts which are ſtiffe, and the Sinews which are hard, to mollifie, ſupple, and ſtretch them forth. It helpeth the cold griefs of the womb, and the windineſſe thereof, it comforteth the brain and Nerves, and helpeth the wearineſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of them, if they come of cold: it helps the dead Palſie, the back, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Region along the Back-bone) being anointed with it, being ſnuffed up in the noſe, it helps <hi>Spaſmus Cynicus,</hi> which is a wrying the mouth aſide: It helps noyſe in the Ears, being dropped in them: it provokes the Terms, and helpeth the bitings of venomous Beaſts; it is a moſt gallant Oyl to ſtrengthen the Body, the back being anointed, it ſtrengthens the Muſcles, they being chafed with it; it helps the Head-ach, the forehead being rubbed with it. Alſo this Herb hath the property of heating all the inward Members, it ſoftneth the Milt, and aſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the ſwelling thereof. The Decoction of it doth help thoſe that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to fall into a Dropſie: thoſe that cannot make water, and the pains and torments in the belly. The Flower and Herb put in a fine bagg, and that apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſtomack, doth take away the pain and grief thereof. The powder of the Leaves ſnifted up into the noſe, doth both cleanſe and heat the Head, and ſtayeth Rheum, eſpecially if it be mixed with a little Ginger. Laſtly, it is uſed in all odoriferous Waters, Powders, &amp;c. and is a chief Ingredient in moſt of thoſe Powders that Barbers uſe, in whoſe Shops I have ſeen great ſtore of this Herb hanged up.</p>

                  <p>Primroſes are uſually called in Latine <hi>Primulae Veris,</hi> becauſe they are the firſt that flouriſh in the Spring, or at leaſt flower with the firſt; nay, ſometimes

In Engliſh, Petty <hi>Mullens,</hi> or Palſie worts, but moſt commonly Cowſlips. The greater ſort called for the moſt part Ox-lips and Paigles, are named of divers, <hi>Herba S.

                  <p>Bears-Ear is a beautiful and brave plant, having green, thick and fat leaves ſomewhat finely ſnipt about the edges, not altogether unlike thoſe of Cowſlips, but ſmoother, greener, and nothing rough or crumpled; among which ariſeth up a ſlender round ſtemme an handful high, bearing a tuft of flowers at the top, ſometimes of a yellow, ſometimes of a purple or red, and ſometimes of a white colour, not much unlike to the flowers of Oxlipps, but more open, and conſiſting of one onely Leaf like Cotiledon or Pennywort, the root is very threddy, and like unto the Oxelip.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>Primroſes and Cowſlips joy moſt in ſhadowy places, and therefore are moſt commonly found in Woods and borders of fields near to the bedge ſides. The purple Primroſe, the double Primroſe, the green Primroſe, the double Paigſes and the Cowſlips two in a hoſe are ſeldom ſeen but in Gardens. The Red and white Birdeine do grow very plentifully in the Northern parts of this land, as in <hi>Harwood</hi> near <hi>Blackburn</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> at <hi>Crosby, Ravenswaith,</hi> and <hi>Cragge Cloſe</hi> in <hi>Weſtmoreland,</hi> and in ſome other places. The Originall of the <hi>Auricula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> came firſt from the mountaines of <hi>Germany, Hungary Italy,</hi> as the <hi>Alpes</hi> and <hi>Pyrences,</hi> &amp;c. But the greateſt variety hath riſen from the Seed, many of them

                  <p>The Lilly of the Valley hath leaves, ſomewhat like unto other white Lillies, or rather like unto the leaves of the ſmalleſt water Plantain, among which doth a ſlender and ſmall ſtalk ſpring up; in the top of which grow forth little ſmall white flowers like little bells, with turned edges, and of a pleaſant ſmell; which being paſt there come ſmall red berries, much like the berries of <hi>Aſparagus.</hi> wherein the ſeed is contained.

I aſſent rather to the former opinion, though there may be ſome reaſon given for the later alſo. The flowers be more effectual then the Herb, and the root paſſeth the flowers in vertue. It cureth the <hi>Apoplexy</hi> by Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for as that diſeaſe is cauſed by the dropping of humours into the principall Ventricles of the brain: ſo the flowers of this Lilly hanging on the plants as if they were drops, are of wonderful uſe herein, if they be diſtilled with Wine, and the quantity of a ſpoonfull thereof drunk, and ſo it reſtoreth ſpeech to them that have the dumb Palſy; And is good againſt the Gout, comforteth the heart and Vitall Spirits, ſtrengthens the brain, recrutes a weak memory, and makes it ſtrong again. The diſtilled water dropped into the Eyes helps inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there is alſo that infirmity which is called the Pin and Web.

Alſo it doth take away the ſcabbe and ring-Worm anointed thereupon; and the ſooner, if you waſh them ſundry times with the water. The water alſo aſſwageth the ſwellings of the ſtingings of Bees and Waſps, if it be applyed to the part. Take the flowers and ſteep them in New Wine for the ſpace of a moneth, which being finiſhed take them out again and diſtill the wine five times over in a Limbeck. This wine is more precious then Gold: for if any one that is troubled with the <hi>Apoplexy</hi> drink thereof, with ſix grains of Pepper, and a little Lavander water they ſhall not need to fear it that moneth; It ceaſeth the Cholick, it comforteth the brain, and helpeth the Impoſtume in the hinder part thereof. Six ounces of the water of the flowers, helpeth thoſe that are poyſoned or bit with a mad Dog, and being drunk fourty daies, it doth away the falling Sckneſſe. The ſame water drunk helpeth the Strangury, the pricking about the heart and inflammation of the Liver, and ſtayeth exceſſive Menſtrues. <hi>Gerrard</hi> ſaith, That a Glaſſe being filled with the flowers of <hi>May</hi> Lillies, and ſet in an Ant-hill with the mouth cloſe ſtopped for a months ſpace, and then taken out, you ſhall find a Liquor in the Glaſſe, which being outwardly applyed helps the Gout very much.</p>

                  <p>The Down of Quinces doth in ſome ſort reſemble the hair of the Head, the Decoction whereof is very effectual for the reſtoring of Hair that is fallen off by the French Pox, and being made up with Wax, and laid on as a Plaſter, it bringeth Hair to them that are bald, and keepeth it from falling, if it be ready to ſhed: It healeth Plague-ſores, if it be boyled in Wine, and applyed to them. The Syrup of the Juyce of Quinces ſtrengthens the heart and ſtomach, ſtayes looſneſs and vomiting, relieves languiſhing Nature: for looſneſs, take a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of it before meat, for vomiting after meat; for others purpoſes it is to be taken in the morning, and may be then taken for theſe alſo. It helpeth the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver alſo, when it is ſo oppreſt, that it cannot perfect digeſtion, and correcteth Choler and Flegme.

The Juyce of raw Quinces is held as an Antidote againſt the force of deadly poyſon, not ſuffering it to have any force in the body; for it hath been often found to be moſt certain true, that the very ſmell of a Quince hath taken away all the ſtrength of the poyſon of white <hi>Hellebore,</hi> which the Hunters of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Navarre</hi> make to kill wilde Beaſts, by dipping their Arrow-Heads therein. It is alſo certain, that if Quinces be brought into an houſe, where Grapes are hung up to be kept dry all the year, they will aſſuredly rot. If there be need of any outward binding, and cooling of any hot Fluxes, the Oyl of Quinces, or other Medicines that may be made thereof, are very available, to anoint the Belly, or other parts therewith: It likewiſe ſtrengtheneth the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and Belly, and the Sinews, which are looſed by ſharp humours falling on them, and reſtraineth immoderate ſweatings. The Mucilage taken from the Seeds and Quinces, boyled a little in water, is very good to cool the heat, and heal the ſore breaſts of Women: the ſame with a little Sugar, is good to lenifie the harſhneſs, and hoarſneſs of the throat, and roughneſs of the Tongue. The Marmalade of Quinces is toothſom, as well as wholſom, and therefore I cannot blame ſuch Gentlewomen, which are ſeldom without it in their Cloſets.</p>

                  <p>A Decoction of the long Moſſe that hangs upon Trees, in a manner like hair, is very profitable to be uſed in the falling off of the hair, and this it doth by Signature. The common ground Moſſe is held to be ſingular good to break the Stone, and to expell and drive it forth by Urine, being boyled in Wine, and drunk. The Herb bruiſed and boyled in water, and then applyed to any Inflammations, or pains, riſing from a hot cauſe, doth allay and eaſe them; and therefore they do apply it to the hot Gout, to allay the pains thereof. The Cup Moſſe is thought to be a ſingular Remedy againſt the Falling-Sickneſs, and the Chin-Cough in Children, if it be powdered, and then given in ſweet Wine for certain dayes together. The Club-Moſſe hung in a Veſſel of Wine, that hath loſt the vigour and vertue, that floateth, and is become ſlimy, reſtoreth it to its former goodneſs, if the quantity thereof be anſwerable to the bigneſs of the Veſſel, whereupon <hi>Brunfelſius</hi> hath called it <hi>Wein Kraut,</hi> the Wine-Herb. The Moſſe of Trees, eſpecially of the Oak, is of good uſe and effect to ſtay Fluxes and Lasks in Man or Woman: as alſo vomiting and bleedings, ſpitting of blood, piſſing of blood, the Tearms, and the Bloody Flux, if the powder there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be boyled in Wine and drunk. The Decoction thereof in Wine is very good for Women to be bathed with, or to ſit in, that are troubled with abundance of their Courſes: the ſame alſo drunk, doth ſtay the troubled Stomack, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed with caſting, or the <hi>Hickok,</hi> and doth alſo comfort the heart, as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith; and as <hi>Serapio</hi> ſaith, procureth deep ſleep: ſome have thought it availa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the Dropſie, if the Powder thereof be taken in drink for ſome time toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Oyl of Roſes that hath freſh Moſſe ſteeped therein for a time, and after boyled, and applyed to the Temples and forehead, doth marvellouſly eaſe the Head-ach, that commeth of a hot cauſe: as alſo the diſtillations of hot Rheum or Humours to the Eyes or other parts. The Ancients much uſed it in their Oyntments, &amp;c. againſt wearineſs, and to ſtrengthen and comfort the Sinews. My Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> ſaith, that there is a ſweet Moſſe growing upon Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-Trees, which is of excellent uſe for Perfumers, who if they knew it, would greedily catch after it. The Moſſe that groweth upon dead Mens Skulls, hath not only been in former times much accounted of, becauſe it is rare, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gotten; but in our times, much more ſet by, to make the <hi>Unguentum Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patheticum,</hi> or Weapon-Salve, which cureth wounds without locall applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: in the compoſition whereof, this is put as a principal Ingredient, but

And ſome yet more neatly make a water to clear the Eye-ſight in this manner: They powder ſome white Sugar Candy very finely, and put that Powder into the hollow green ſtalk of Fennel, while it groweth a foot above the ground, ſo that it be between two joynts, which having remained therein two or three dayes, and the hole covered and bound cloſe over, that no rain get in, they open it at the lower joynt, having firſt placed a good peece of ſoft wax, made a little hollow, gutter-wiſe, under the hole, which may ſerve to carry the liquor from falling down the ſtalk into a Veſſel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or thing ſet of purpoſe, thereto to receive it.

The ſeed is of good uſe in pectorall Medicines, and thoſe which help the ſhortneſs of the breath, and wheeſings by obſtructions of the Lungs, it helpeth alſo to bring down the Courſes, and to cleanſe the parts after delivery. The Roots are of moſt uſe in Phyſick Drinks and Broths, that are taken to cleanſe the blood, to open the obſtructions of the Liver, to provoke Urine, to amend the evill colour or complexion in the face, after long ſickneſs, and to cauſe a good colour, and a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52711:29"/> good habit throughout the whole body. Fennell both Leaves and Seeds or roots, are much uſed in drinks and broths, for thoſe that are grown fat to abate their unweldineſſe, and make them more gaunt and lank. The ſweet Fennel by reaſon of its ſweetneſſe is much weaker then the ordinary, which is better for all the Phyſicall purpoſes aforeſaid; And therefore they do but deceive themſelves and others that uſe the ſweet Fennel Seed, in compoſitions as thinking it better, when as it is much weaker by want of the bitterneſſe which is moſt operative. The Juyce killeth the worms in the ears, if it be dropped therein. The wild Fennel is ſtronger and hotter then the tame, and therefore more powerfull againſt the ſtone, but not ſo effectual to increaſe milk, becauſe of its dryneſs. Let them that live in thoſe Countryes where there be any Serpents or Snakes, have a care they waſh their Fennel before they uſe it: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they delight much to be amongſt it; it is thought that they make uſe of it to preſerve their Eyeſight. Fennel roots are one of the five opening roots; the other four being Smallage, <hi>Aſparagus,</hi> Parſly, Kneeholly or Butchersbroom, called in Latine, <hi>Ruſcus Bruſcus</hi>

                  <p>The Flowers of Vervein in ſome ſort repreſenting the Eye, are no ſmall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that it is thereunto to be appropriated. The diſtilled water of the Herb when it is in full ſtrength, cleanſeth them from Films, Clouds, or Miſts that darken the ſight, and wonderfully ſtrengtheneth the Optick Nerves. If the Herb it ſelf be ſtamped with the white of an Egg, and laid to the Eye that is ſwollen or blood-ſhot, when you go to bed it will cure it. It is alſo an excellent Herb for the Womb, to ſtrengthen it, and to cure all the cold griefs of it, as Plantain doth the hot. It helpeth the yellow Jaundice, the Dropſie, and the Gout: the defects of the Reigns and Longs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and generally all inward pains and torments of the body, the Leaves being boyled and drunk. The ſame is held to be good againſt the biting of Serpents, and other venomous Beaſts, the Plague, both <hi>Tertian</hi> and <hi>Quartan</hi> Agues, and the Worms in the Belly. It cauſeth a good Colour in the Face and Body, ſtrengtheneth the Liver and Spleen, as well as correcteth the Diſeaſes of them, is very effectuall in all Diſeaſes of the Stomack and Lungs, as Coughs, ſhortneſs of breath, and wheeſings, and is ſingular good againſt the Dropſie, to be drunk with ſome <hi>Piony</hi> Seeds, bruiſed and put there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: And is no leſſe prevalent for the defects of the Reins and Bladder, to cleanſe thoſe humours that engender the Stone, and helpeth to break the Stone, and to expel Gravel. It conſolidateth and healeth all wounds, both inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſtayeth bleedings, and uſed with ſome Honey, healeth all old Ulcers, and Fiſtulaes in the Legs or other parts of the Body: as alſo thoſe Ulcers that happen in the mouth, or uſed with old Hogs-greaſe, it helpeth the ſwellings and pains of the ſecret parts in Man or Woman: as alſo thoſe Ulcers that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the mouth, applyed with ſome Oyl of Roſes and Vinegar unto the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head and Temples, it eaſeth the inveterate pains and ach of the head, and is good for thoſe which are frantick. the Leaves bruiſed, or mixed with ſome Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, doth wonderfully cleanſe the skin, and taketh away Morphew, Freckles, Fiſtulaes, and ſuch other like Inflammations, and Deformities of the skin, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of the Body; and ſo doth the diſtilled water, which is alſo very power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in inward Diſeaſes, and likewiſe in outward, whether they be old corroding Sores, or green wounds. The Female Vervein is held to be more powerful then the common; but that of <hi>Peru</hi> exceedeth them both. <hi>Monardus</hi> reported, that a

Alſo Honey of Roſes ſolutive, is made of the ſame infuſion, that the Syrup is, and worketh the ſame effect, both in opening and purging, but is oftner given to Phlegmatick, then cholerick perſons, and is more uſed in Clyſters, then in Potions, as the Syrup made with Sugar is. The Conſerve and preſerved leaves of theſe Roſes, are alſo operative, in gently opening the Belly. The ſimple water of the Damask Roſes is much uſed for fumes to ſweeten things, as alſo to put into Pyes, and Broths, &amp;c. as the dryed Leaves thereof, to make ſweet Powders, and fill ſweet Bags, but are ſeldom uſed in Phyſick, although they have ſome purging quality. The wild Roſes are few, or none of them uſed in Phyſick, yet are generally held to come near the nature of the manured Roſes. The fruit of the wild Bryar, which are called Heps, being throughly ripe, and made into a Conſerve with Sugar beſides the pleaſantneſs of the taſte, doth gently bind the belly, and ſtay the defluxions from the head, upon the ſtomach, drying up the moyſture there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and helping digeſtion. The Pulp of the Heps, dryed into a hard conſiſtence, like to the juyce of Liquorice; or ſo dryed, that it may be made into Powder, and taken in drink; ſtayeth ſpeedily whites in Women. The Bryar-Ball is often uſed, being made into Powder, and drunk to break the ſtone, to provoke Urine when it is ſtopped, and to eaſe and help the Cholick.</p>

                     <hi>Parkinſon</hi> treats of Pilewort in the ſame Chapter with Celandine, which are no more alike, then Chalk and Cheeſe, neither in Leaf nor Flower, only becauſe it is called <hi>Chelidonium minus,</hi> from an error of Dioſcorides, who ſaith, that it ſpringeth when Swallows come in, and withereth at their going away, when as it ſpringeth before Swallows come, and vaniſheth long before their departure. Therefore I ſhall not mention that any more here, but ſhall ſet down the kinds of the greater Celandine, which I find to be three. 1. Common great Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landine. 2.

                  <p>Common Celandine hath divers tender, round, whitiſh, green ſtalks, with greater Joynts then other Herbs ordinarily have like unto knees, very brittle and eaſie to break, from whence grow branches with large tender long Leaves, divided into many parts, each of them cut-in on the edges, ſet at the joynts on both ſides of the branches, of a dark blewiſh green colour, on the upper ſide, like Columbines, and of a more pale blewiſh green underneath, full of a yellow ſap, when any part is broken, of a bitter taſt, and ſtrong ſcent: at the tops of the branches, which are much divided, grow gold yellow Flowers, of four Leaves a peece, after which come ſmall long pods, with blackiſh ſeed therein: the root is thick and knobby, with ſome threds annexed thereto, which being broken or bruiſed, yieldeth a ſap or juyce of the colour of Gold.</p>

                  <p>The common ſort groweth in many places by old Walls, by the hedges and way ſides, in untilled places; and being once planted in a Garden, eſpecially in ſome ſhady place, it will hardly be gotten out. The ſecond, is not known to grow naturally, but is received into Gardens for the variety. The third, in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada,</hi> as the Title ſheweth. The two firſt ſorts flower all the Summer long, and the ſeed ripeneth in the mean time; but the laſt flowreth very late, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not its ſeed to perfection in this Country.</p>

                  <p>Though <hi>Ariſtotlc</hi> will not admit that this Herb cureth the Eys of young Swallows, yet it hath been proved, by experience, that it is one of the beſt cures for mens Eyes that is; for the juyce dropped into the Eyes, clenſeth them from films and clowdineſs, which darken the ſight; but it is beſt to allay the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it, with a little Breaſt-Milk. Mr. <hi>Culpepper</hi> ſaith, that the Oyl or Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is moſt effectual, if it be anointed upon ſore Eyes, and that it is far better then endangering the Eyes with a Needle, The Herb or Roots boyled in White-wine and drunk, a few Annlſeeds being boyled therewith, openeth Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of the Liver and Gall, helpeth the yellow Jaundice by Signature, which is plainly ſignified by the yellow juyce; and, after often uſing, it helps the Dropſie, and the Itch, and thoſe that have old ſores in their Legs, or other parts of the Body. The juyce thereof taken faſting, is held to be of ſingular good uſe againſt the Plague or Peſtilence, and ſo is the diſtilled water alſo, with a little Sugar; but eſpecially if a little good Treacle be mixed therewith, and they upon the taking, lie down to ſweat a little: It is good in old filthy corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding creeping Ulcers whatſoever, to ſtay the ſtelalignity of fretting, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and to cauſe them to heal the more ſpeedily: The juyce often applyed to Tetters, Ring-worms, or other ſuch like ſpreading Cancers, will quickly heal them, and rubbed oft on Warts, will take them away. The Herb, with the Roots bruiſed, and heated with the Oyl of Camomile, and applyed to the Navel, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away both the griping pain in the Belly and Bowels, as all the pains of the Mother, and applyed to Womens Breaſts that have their Courſes over much, ſtayeth them. The Juyce or Decoction of the Herb, gargled between the teeth that ake, taketh away the pain; and the Powder of the dryed Root, layd upon an aking, hollow, or looſe Tooth, will, as ſome ſay, cauſe it to drop out. The Juyce mixed with Powder of Brimſtone, is not only good to anoint thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are troubled with the Itch, but taketh away all diſcolourings of the skin whatſoever, be they ſpots of marks or bruiſes, ſtripes or wounds, the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew alſo, Sun-burning, or any the like; and if by chance in a tender body, it cauſe any Itching or Inflammation, it is ſoon helped, if the place be but bathed with a little Vineger. <hi>Matthiolus</hi> ſaith, that if the green Herb be worn in the ſhooes of them that have the yellow Jaundies, ſo as their bare feet may tread thereon, it helpeth them.</p>

                     <l>Infuſeth wit, and Fleas doth put to flight.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>Concerning Chaſtity, I have ſpoken ſomewhat already in the Names; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it repaireth the Eyeſight and ſharpeneth it, if it be eaten green as is there mentioned; <hi>Ruta comeſta recens oculos caligine purgat.</hi> Or elſe the Juice of Rue together with the Juyce of Fennel, the Gall of a Cock, and clarified honey being put into the Eyes helpeth the dimneſſe of them. The third property is, that Rue maketh a man quick, ſubtill and inventive, by reaſon that by heating and drying it maketh a mans Spirits ſubtile, and ſo cleareth the wit. The fourth is, that the water wherein good ſtore of Rue hath been ſodden, being caſt and ſprinked about the houſe riddeth away Fleas and killeth them. Beſides, theſe foreſaid properties, it provoketh Urine, and Womens Courſes being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken either in meat or drink. The Seed thereof taken in Wine, is an Antidote againſt all dangerous Medicines or deadly Poyſons. The very ſmell of Rue keepeth a man from Infection, as is often proved in time of peſtilence; for a Noſegay thereof is a good Preſervative; but being received into the body, it is of much greater force. A Decoction made thereof, with ſome dryed Dill Leaves and Flowers, eaſeth all pains and torments inwardly to be drunk, and outwardly to be applyed warm to the place grieved. The ſame being drunk helpeth the pains both of the Cheſt and Sides; as alſo Coughs and hardneſſe of breathing, the Inflammations of the Lungs, and the tormenting pains of the <hi>Sciatica</hi> and the Joynts, being anointed or laid to the places; as alſo the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king fits of Agues, to take a draught before the fit come: Being boyled or infuſed in Oyl, it is good to help the wind Collick, the hardneſſe or windineſs of the Mother; and freeth Women from the ſtrangling or ſuffocation thereof, if the Share and parts thereabouts be anointed therewith; It killeth and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth forth Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

A Decoction of it and Bay Leaves helpeth the ſwelling of the Codds, if they be bathed therewith: if it be bruiſed with a few Myrtle leaves and made up with wax and applyed, it taketh away Wheales and Pimples; It cureth the Morphew, and taketh away all ſorts of Warts, if boyled in Wine with ſome pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Nitre and the places rubbed therewith, and with Allom and Honey helpeth the dry Scab, or any Tetter or Ringworm.

A Weaſell being to fight with a Serpent, eateth Rue, and rubbeth her ſelf therewith to avoid his poyſon. I know not what religion <hi>Crollius</hi> was of: but he ſaith, that the ſigne of the Croſſe which is upon the ſeed; or rather, as I ſuppoſe, the flower of Rue driveth away all Phantaſms, and evill Spirits, by Signature.</p>

By which ſignature it hath been found out, that this herb is very effectual for the curing of the ſame, and for removing dimneſſe of ſight, either the Powder of the dry herb, or the Juice of the green. The diſtilled water is very effectuall for the ſaid purpoſe, to be taken either inwardly in Wine or in Broth, or to be dropped into the Eyes, and uſed for divers daies together. Some alſo make a Conſerve of the flower to the ſame effect.

                     <hi>Aſarabacca</hi> hath many Heads riſing from the Roots, from whence come ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſmooth Leaves, every one upon his own footſtalk, which are rounder and big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then Violet Leaves, thicker alſo, ſmoother and of a darker green ſhining colour on the upperſide, and of a paler yellow green underneath, little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing dented about the Edges; from among which ariſe ſmall round hollow browniſh green husks upon ſtalks, of about an inch long, divided at the brims into five diviſions, very like the Cups or Heads of the Henbane ſeed, but that they are ſmaller: and theſe be all the flowers it hath, which being ſmelled unto, are ſomewhat ſweet; and wherein when they are ripe, are contained ſmall cornered rough ſeeds, very like the kernels or ſtones of Grapes or Raiſins. The roots are ſmall and whitiſh, ſpreading diverſe waies in the ground, and increaſing into divers heads, but not running or creeping under the ground as ſome other creeping herbs do: They are ſomewhat ſweet in ſmell, reſembling <hi>Nardus,</hi> but more when they are dry then green, and of a ſharp but not unpleaſant Taſte.</p>

                  <head>The Signature and Vertues.</head>
                  <p>By the Leaves of <hi>Aſarabacca,</hi> the Ears of a man are in ſome ſort repreſented, and it is found by experience, that a Conſerve may be made of the flowers of this Plant, which being eat, doth very much ſtrengthen and encreaſe both hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and memory. The memory is alſo holpen, and the Head and Brain, that is ill affected by taking cold, comforted; if the Leaves and Roots be boyled in Lee, and the head often waſhed therewith while it is warm. The Common uſe hereof is to take the juyce of five or Seaven Leaves in a little drink, which not only provoketh Vomiting, but purgeth downward, and by Urine alſo, purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both Choler and Phlegme, if you add to it ſome Spikenard, and the whey of Goats Milk, or Honyed water: but it purgeth Phlegme more manifeſtly then Choler; and therefore doth much help pains in the Hips and other parts. Being boyled in Whey, it wonderfully helpeth the Obſtructions of the Liver and Spleen, and is profitable for the Dropſie and Jaundies, being ſteeped in Wine and drunk. It helps thoſe continuall Agues that come by the plenty of ſtubborn humours. An Oyl made thereof by ſetting it in the Sun, with ſome <hi>Laudanum</hi> added to it, provoketh ſweating (the ridge of the back being anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therewith) and thereby driveth away the ſhaking fits of the Agues. It will not abide long boyling, for it looſeth its ſtrength thereby; nor much beating, for the finer powder doth provoke Vomits and Urine, and the coorler purgeth downward. The Roots alſo work in the ſame manner, but not ſo forcibly: but an Extract made thereof, according to Art, with Wine, might be more ſafe and effectual, and may be kept all the year to be ready at hand to be given, when there is occaſion, the quantity only is to be proportioned, according to the conſtitution of the Patient, as the learned Phyſitians can beſt appoint. It is alſo effectuall againſt the biting of Serpents, (the root eſpecially) and therefore it is put amongſt other ſimples, both into Mithridate and <hi>Venice</hi> Treacle. A drachm of the root in powder given in Whitewine, a little before the fit of an Ague, taketh away the ſhaking fit, and thereby cauſeth the hot fit to be more remiſſe, and in twice taking expelleth it quite. It is ſaid that the leaves being a little bruiſed, and applyed to the forehead and temples, do eaſe the pains of the head, and procureth ſleep; and applyed to the Eyes taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the inflammation of them. The Juice with a little <hi>Tutia</hi> prepared, put to it, and dropped into the corner of the Eyes, ſharpeneth the Eyeſight, and taketh away the dimneſſe and miſtineſſe that is often in them. The Baſtard <hi>Aſarum,</hi> as <hi>Matthiolus</hi> ſaith, hath a little cleanſing quality, but a greater property to attenuate, or make thin that which is thick, to cut or break that which is tough, and to open that which is obſtructed. A drachm of the powder hereof taken, in ſweet Wine, or honyed Water, doth looſen the Belly, and purgeth from thence tough and thick phlegme, and black or burnt Humours: It is for very good purpoſe and profit, given to thoſe which have the yellow Jaundies, to thoſe that have the falling Sickneſſe, and to thoſe that have the Palſy, the herbe either taken of it ſelf, and eaten as in Sallets, or the decoction thereof made and drunk: It killeth alſo the wormes of the Belly.</p>

The Juyces of Celandine, Dayſies of the field, and Ground-Ivy clarified, and a little fine Sugar diſſolved therein, dropped into the Eys, is a ſoveraign Medicine for all pains, redneſs, and watering of the Eys, the Pin and Web, Skins or Films growing over the ſight, or whatſoever might offend them: the ſame helpeth Beaſts as well as Men. It is alſo a ſingular good Wound-Herb, for all inward Wounds, and likewiſe for exulcerated Lungs, and other parts, either by it ſelf, or with other the like Herbs boyled together; and beſides, being drunk by them that have any griping pains of windy or cholerick humours in the ſtomack, ſpleen or belly, doth eaſe them in a ſhort ſpace: it likewiſe helpeth the yellow Jaundies, by opening the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Gall, Liver, and Spleen, it expelleth venome and poyſon, and the Plague alſo. It provoketh Urine, and Womens Courſes, and ſtayeth them not, as ſome have thought; but the Decoction of the Herb in Wine, being drunk for ſome time together by thoſe, that have the Sciatica, or Hip-Gout, as alſo the Gout in the hands, knees, or feet, helpeth to diſſolve, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe the peccant humours, and to procure eaſe: the ſame decoction is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent good to gargle any ſore throat or mouth, putting thereto ſome Honey, and a little burnt Allome: as alſo to waſh the Sores and Ulcers of the privy parts, in Man or Woman. It ſpeedily healeth green wounds, being bound thereto. The Juyce boyled with a little Honey and Verdigreaſe, doth wonderfully cleanſe Fiſtulaes, and hollow Ulcers: It helpeth alſo the Itch, Scabs, Wheals, and other eruptions, or exulcerations in the skin, in any part of the body, and ſtayeth the malignity of ſpreading or eating Cancers and Ulcers. Country people heretofore did often uſe to run it up with their drink, not only for the clearing of the ſight, and other ſpecial Vertues that it hath; but for that it will help alſo to clear their drink. This Age forſaketh all old things, though never ſo good, and embraceth all kind of novelties whatſoever; but the time will come, that the ſopperies of the preſent times ſhall be ſlighted, and the true and honeſt preſcriptions of the Antients come in requeſt again.

The Juyce of the Leaves and Berries, with a little Oyl of bitter Almonds, dropped into the Ears, whileſt it is warm, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the hearing, and cureth all the old and running ſores of them. The Berries made into Powder, and drunk in Wine, help to break the ſtone, provoke urine, and Womens Courſes, as <hi>Tragus</hi> ſaith; yea ſo powerfull they are in thoſe parts, that a bath made of the Leaves and Berries for Women to ſit in, or over the fumes, or a peſſary made of them, and put up, doth mightily prevail to bring them down, and to draw forth the dead birth, and after-birth; but this to be cautelouſly uſed, and that only in Caſes of extremity. The freſh Leaves of Ivy, boyled in Vineger, and applyed warm to the ſides of thoſe which are ſplene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, or troubled with any Ach or Stitch in their ſides, doth give them much eaſe: the ſame applyed with Roſe-water, and Oyl of Roſes, to the Forehead and Temples, doth eaſe the inveterate pains of the head. If the freſh Leaves be boyled in Wine, and old filthy Sores and Ulcers, that are hard to be cured, be waſhed therewith, it wonderfully helpeth to cleanſe and heal them, and ſo it doth green wounds, quickly ſodering up the lips of them: the ſame alſo is effectual to heal ſcaldings of water, and burnings by fire, and the exulcerations that happen thereby, or upon the ſharpneſs of ſalt flegme, and hot humours in other parts of the body. The Juyce of the Berries or Leaves ſnuffed up into the noſe, purgeth the head and brain of thin Rheum, which maketh defluctions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Eyes and Noſe, and cureth the Ulcers and ſtench therein. The freſh leaves are commonly uſed to lay upon Iſſues, in what place ſoever, as Arms, Legs, &amp;c. to keep them open, and to draw forth the humours, which come thither: but a little peece of the Root, made round like a peaſe, and put into the Orifice, keepeth it running without Leaf or Plaſter, if you lay upon it half a ſheet of iſſue-Paper
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52711:39"/> eight times double. The Wood made into a Cup, and uſed by thoſe that are troubled with the Spleen, ſhall find eaſe and be much holpen thereof, if they let their drink ſtand ſome ſmall time therein before they drink it. <hi>Cato</hi> ſaith, if you ſuſpect your Wine to have any water in it, put ſome of it into a Cup made of Ivy wood, and the Wine will ſoak through, and the water remain: ſuch is the Antipathy that is betwixt them. If any one hath got a ſurfet by drinking of Wine, his ſpeedieſt cure is to drink a draught of the ſame wine wherein an handfull of Ivy leaves, being firſt bruiſed, have been boyled. There is a Gum gathered from Ivy in hot Countries, which is exceeding ſharp and hot, burning and exulcerating the skin; yet being diſſolved in Vinegar, it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away ſuperfluous hair in any place, and killeth Lice and Nits, and eaſeth the pain of hollow teeth, if it be put therein.</p>

                  <p>I deſcribed the Black Poplar, becauſe that had moſt ſimilitude with Ivy; but it is the white Poplar (whoſe form differeth not much from the other, ſave that the leaves are almoſt like thoſe of the Vine, or rather Colts-foot) which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the Ears, the juyce of whoſe leaves being extracted warmed and dropped into them eaſeth the pains in them, and healeth Ulcers there, if there be any. The young clammy buds, or eyes, before they break out into leaves bruiſed, and a little Honey put to them, is a good Medicine for a dull ſight by Signature. An ounce of the bark in Powder being drunk, ſaith <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> in wine, 'tis likely, is a remedy for thoſe that are troubled with the Sciatica or Srangury; and <hi>Serenus</hi> is of the ſame Judgment. The black Poplar is held by ſome to be more cooling then the white; and therefore they have with much profit applyed the leaves bruiſed with Vinegar to places troubled with the Gout, and ſo do the young leaves and buds made into an Ointment with <hi>May</hi>-butter: the ſeed is held to be good againſt the falling ſickneſſe, if it be drunk in Vinegar. That water that droppeth from the hollow places of the black Poplars, doth take away Warts, Puſhes, Wheales, and other the like break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings out in the body.

                  <p>The Berries of Night-ſhade having ſome ſimilitude with a Bladder, are of excellent uſe to provoke Urine, and to expel the ſtone, eſpecially the Seeds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them, being drunk with White-wine. It is commonly uſed to cool hot Inflammations, either inwardly or outwardly, being no way dangerous to any that ſhall uſe it, as the reſt of the Night-ſhades are, if it be uſed moderately; for, the often taking thereof in too great a quantity, procureth the Frenzy: the remedy whereof, is to take good ſtore of warm honyed water. The Juyce drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped into the Ears eaſeth the pains thereof, that ariſe of heat or Inflammation: The diſtilled water only of the whole Herb, is fitteſt and ſafeſt to be taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. The Juyce alſo clarified, and mingled with Vineger, is a good Garga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſme for the mouth and throat that is inflamed. But outwardly the Juyce of the Herb or Berries, with Oyl of Roſes, and a little Vineger, and Ceruſſe, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured together in a leaden Mortar, is very good to anoint all hot Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Eys: It doth alſo much good for the Shingles, Ringworms, and in all running, fretting, and corroding Ulcers, and in moiſt Fiſtulaes: if the juyce be made up with ſome Hens-Dung, and applyed thereto. A Peſſary dipped in the Juyce, and put up into the Matrix, ſtayeth the immoderate Flux of Womens Courſes. A Cloth wet therein, and applyed to the Teſticles or Cods, upon any ſwelling therein, giveth much eaſe, as alſo to the Gout, which commeth of hot and ſharp humours. The deadly Night-ſhade is very dangerous to be taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, as might be ſhown by ſome lamentable inſtances: yet if the Temples and forehead be a little bathed with the Juyce of Leaves, and a little Vineger, it procureth reſt and ſleep, when it is hindered by hot fits of Agues, or other diſtemperature, and taketh away the pain of the head, proceeding of a hot cauſe.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52711:41"/> The Leaves bruiſed, or their Juyce may be applyed to ſuch hot Inflammations, as St. <hi>Anthonies</hi> fire, the Shingles, and all other fiery or running Cankers, to cool and ſtay the ſpreading.</p>

                  <head>The Vertues.</head>
                  <p>As Night-ſhade being a cold Plant, was good for ſuch diſtempers of the Ears, as happen by reaſon of heat: ſo this Hog-Fennel being of a hot temperature, is very effectual for ſuch griefs as happen to the Ears upon a cold cauſe, if a little of the juyce be diſſolved in Wine, and dropped into the Ears. The ſame, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> uſed with Vineger and Roſe-water, or the juyce, with a little <hi>Euphorbium</hi> put to the Noſe, helpeth thoſe that are troubled with the Lethargy, the Phrenſie, the turning of the brain, or diſſineſs of the head; the Falling-Sickneſs, long and inveterate Head-ach, the Palſie, the Sciatica, and the Cramp; and generally all the Diſeaſes of the Nerves and Sinews, if it be uſed with Oyl and Vineger. The juyce diſſolved in Wine, or put into an Egg, is good for the Cough, and ſhortneſs of breath, and for thoſe that are troubled with wind, and tormenting pains in the body. It purgeth the belly gently, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolveth the wind, and hardneſs of the ſpleen, it giveth eaſe to thoſe Women that have ſore travel in Child-birth, and eaſeth the pains both of Bladder and Reins, and womb alſo. A little of the concrete juyce put into an hollow Tooth, ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the pains thereof, and the Root worketh to the like effect; but more ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and leſſe. The dryed Powder of the Root, being put into foul Ulcers, of hard curation, clenſeth them throughly, removeth any ſplinters of broken bones, or other things in the fleſh, and healeth them up perfectly, and likewiſe bringeth-on old and inveterate ſores to cicatriſing: it is alſo put into ſuch ſalves as ſerve to heat or warm any place. <hi>Pliny</hi> recordeth the vertue hereof in divers places: the Root being drunk in Wine, with the Seed of the Cypreſs-Tree, in powder, eaſeth the ſtrangling of the Mother, but ſome uſe to burn it, and by the ſmell thereof giveth eaſe thereunto: the juyce helpeth the burſtings of Children, and their Navels when they ſtick forth: the Root is of ſo great force in green Wounds and Sores, that it draweth out the Quitture from the very bones. By the Signature of this Plant, it ſhould cauſe hair to grow apace, where the places wanted it, or were deprived; for ſo doth <hi>Thapſia,</hi> or ſcorching Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, which hath leſſe ſimilitude then this.</p>

The Juyce boyled or throughly heated with a little oyl of bitter Almonds in the Pill of a Pomgranate, is a ſure remedy for deafneſſe and ſingings, and all other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes in the Ears; and it is ſaid, that the herb bruiſed and bound upon Warts, will quickly take them away.

The herb it ſelf is very fit to cool an hot Stomach, and to eaſe the gnawing paines thereof; and are therefore eaten by ſome as Sallet herbs in Winter and Spring: being boyled in wine, it is very helpfull to ſtay the diſſolutions of the Stomach; and the milk that is taken from the ſtalks when they are broken, given in drink, is beneficial to thoſe that are ſhort winded, and have a wheeſing withal: <hi>Eriſiſtratus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Pliny,</hi> did therewith cauſe the gravel and ſtone to be voided by Urine; and ſaith, that the eating thereof helpeth a ſtinking breath: The Juyce thereof to the quantity of three ſpoonfuls taken in Wine warmed, and ſome Oyl put thereto, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Women in Travel of Child, to have ſo eaſie and ſpeedy deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, that they may be eaſie to walk preſently after: the ſaid juyce taken in warm drink, helpeth the Strangury, or piſſing by drops, and pains in making water.

It cureth alſo Ruptures in Children quickly, but in thoſe that are elder more time is required, according to the diſpoſition of the party and the continuance. The Decoction hereof in wine being drunk is ſaid to provoke Urine, to help the Strangury and the Stone; and ſo doth the diſtilled water thereof drunk two or three times a day, a ſmall quantity at a time, as alſo to eaſe the paines in the Entralls or Guts, and to be effectual againſt a Cough that cometh by diſtillation of rheume from the head. The Juyce or diſtilled Water being warmed and hot Inflamma ions, Puſtules or Red wheales and other ſuch Eruptions in the skin being bathed therewith doth help them, and doth no leſſe eaſe the ſwellings, heat and Inflammations of the Fundament and privie parts in Man or Woman, and cureth Tetters and Ringworms. The fume of it is good to cauſe children guts to go back into their Body, when as through Flux or cold they hang forth, and ſo it ſtoppeth the immoderate Terms of Women. The young buds are dreſſed by ſome like Aſparagus, or being boyled are often beſtrewed with flower and fryed to be eaten. The ſmother rather then the Rough, and the leaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then the bare, is both more uſed, and of better effect in phyſick.</p>

The Leaves bruiſed with ſome Pepper, and drunk in Wine, do much help the Wind-Cholick. The Leaves only bruiſed and boyled in Wine, and drunk, do much ſtay the heat of luſt, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exſtinguiſh it both in man and woman, if it be much uſed: the Catkins alſo are of the like effect. The water that is gathered from the Willow, whileſt it flowreth, the Bark being ſlit, and a Veſſel apt to receive it, being fitted to it, is very good for redneſſe, and dim eye-ſight, and Films that begin to grow over them, and ſtay the Rheums that fall into them, to provoke Urine, being ſtopped, if it be drunk, and to clear the face and skin of any ſpots or diſcolourings, if waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therewith. The Flowers, ſaith <hi>Galen,</hi> have a ſtronger effect, to dry up any Flux or humour, being a Medicine without any ſharpneſſe, and the Bark much more, as all Barks do; but if the Bark be burnt and uſed, it doth yet dry more forcibly, and being mixed with Vinegar, it taketh away Warts and Corns, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the like callous fleſh, that groweth on the hands or feet, or other parts. The decoctions of the Leaves and Bark in Wine, is good to bath the Sinews, as alſo the places pained with the Gout, and to cleanſe the Head or other parts of ſcurf. The Juyce of the Leaves and green Bark mingled with ſome Roſe-water, and heated in the Rhind of a Pomegranet, is ſingular good to help deafneſs, to be dropped into the Ears. The Seed of the black Willow mixed with Litharge of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52711:48"/> Silver, in equall quantity, made into an Ointment, and uſed on any place, where the hair groweth, that you would take away, after it hath been bathed well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or elſe in the bain or Stove, doth cauſe it to fall away. This Plant is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated by Seed; but any ſtick thereof, though almoſt withered, being fixed in the Earth, groweth: which Signature doth truly declare, that a Bath made of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of the Leaves, and Bark of Willow, reſtoreth again, withered and dead Members, to their former ſtrength, if they be nouriſhed with the fomentation thereof.</p>

The Root of Biſtort, Pellitory of Spain, and burnt Allome, of each a like quantity, beaten ſmall, and made into a Paſt with Honey, a little peece thereof, put into an hollow Tooth, or holden between the teeth, if they be not hollow, ſtayeth the defluxions of Rheum upon them, when it is the cauſe of their pain, and helpeth to cleanſe the Head, and void much offenſive matter. The wreathed form of the Root, is a ſign that is good againſt the bitings of Serpents, or Snakes, for which it is found to be very effectuall: as alſo for the venoming of Toads, Spiders, Adders, or the like venomous Creatures, if the place be waſhed with the water that is diſtilled from the Root and Leaves.

                  <head>The Forme.</head>
                  <p>The common Tormentil hath many reddiſh, ſlender, weak branches riſing from the root, lying upon the ground, or rather leaning then ſtanding upright, with many ſhort leaves that ſtand cloſer to the ſtalks, as the Cinkfoil doth (which this is otherwiſe ſomewhat like) with the footſtalks encompaſſing the Branches in ſeveral places; but they that grow next the ground, are ſet upon longer footſtalks each whereof are like the leaves of Cinkfoil, but ſomewhat longer and leſſer, and dented about the edges, many of them having five diviſions, ſome ſix, moſt ſeaven and ſometimes though ſeldom eight, according to the fertility of the ſoil. At the tops of the branches ſtand divers ſmall yellow flowers conſiſting of five leaves like thoſe of Cinkfoil but ſmaller. The root is ſmaller then Biſtort; ſomewhat thick, tuberous, or knobby, blackiſh without, and reddiſh within as the former, ſometimes a little crooked, having many blackiſh fibres.</p>

                  <p>The root of Tormentil doth mightily dry, and that in the third degre, and is of thin parts; it hath in it but little heat, and is of a binding quality; and therefore it muſt not be given to dry bodies, nor to ſuch as are very coſtive.</p>

                  <head>The Signature and Vertues.</head>
                  <p>The redneſſe of the inſide of the root of Tormentil is an eminent token, that it is moſt excellent to ſtay all kinds of fluxes, of blood or humours in Man or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whether at Noſe, Mouth, Belly, or any wound in the Veins or elſewhere. It provokes ſweat, expells poiſon and is good to cure wounds; the herb, root, and water are in uſe. It is much uſed in the Peſtilence and other malignant diſeaſes, as ſmall Pox, Meaſels, Purples, and ſpotted Feavers, driving forth by ſweat any contagion, eſpecially if the Flux of the belly be joyned with theſe diſeaſes. It is u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The diſtilled Water of Tormentil taken in a morning faſting, is excellent againſt Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom, or any contagion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is a good preſervative in time of infection. The Doſe is two or three Ounces, the ſame taken morning and evening cures all inward Ulcers in the Body ſtayeth the Fluxes of the Belly; eſpecially in the Dyſentery or bloody Flux. It doth comfort the brain, heart, and ſtomach, liver and ſpleen; as alſo the whole body, and cureth moſt agues. The beſt way to ſtill the water is to ſteep the herb all night in Wine, and then diſtill it, <hi>Balneo Mariae.</hi> The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thus diſtilled taken with ſome Venice Treacle, and the party laid preſently to ſweat will certainly, by Gods help, expel any Venom or Poiſon, the Plague, Feaver, &amp;c. For it is an ingredient of ſpeciall reſpect in all Antidotes or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſons. The powder of the dryed root made up with the white of an Egg in the form of a little cake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and baked upon an hot Tile, will ſtay all fluxes, reſtrain all cholerick belchings, and much vomiting with loathings in the ſtomach.

               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Form.</head>
                  <p>The Common black Mulberry tree groweth very great and tall, the body and the greater arms being covered with a thick rugged bark, the younger boughs and branches being ſmoother, whereon are broad roundiſh leaves, ſet pointed at the end, and dented about the edges like Mint leaves, but that they are far big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and ſmoother. The bloomings or flowers are downy like Catkins, after which immediately followeth the fruit made of many grains, ſet together of a pale green colour at firſt, then red when they are harſh and ſowre, but afterwards black when they are full ripe, being full of a ſweetiſh Juyce, which will die the fingers and mouths of them that gather and eat them; wherein ly divers ſmall ſeeds: the root groweth not deep, but ſpreadeth far, being of a yellowiſh colour.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Places and Time.</head>
                  <p>The two former ſorts are nouriſhed up in woods, or great Orchards in the Levant or Eaſtern countries to nouriſh their ſilk Worms, where they keep them in abundance; and may peradventure be natural in ſome of theſe places, they are plentiful nurſed up in <hi>Italy</hi> for the ſame purpoſe, and might have been very numerous here in England; if the Letters of King <hi>James</hi> to the Lords Lievte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of the ſeveral ſhires for the increaſing of Mulberry trees, and the breeding of Silk worms in his Kingdom, had taken their wiſhed effect, which they did not, becauſe they had not the inſtructions to that purpoſe annexed to them. But now the way then thought of, is revived by that induſtrious Common wealths<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>Samuel Hartlib</hi> Eſquire, of propagating them by ſeed; to whoſe book cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Reformed Virginian Silkworm, I refer you: whereas formerly there was no way of propagating but either by ſlips, grafting, or inoculation, which ſeldom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar is good to lay on any place that is burnt with fire. A decoction made of the bark and leaves, is good to waſh the mouth and teeth when they ake. It is reported that if the root be a little ſlit or cut, and a ſmall hole made in the ground next thereunto in the harveſt time, it will give out a certain Juyce, which being hardned is the next day of good uſe to help the Toothach, to diſſolve knots and purge the belly; the leaves are ſaid to ſtay bleeding at mouth and noſe, or the bleeding of the Piles, or of a wound being bound unto the places. A branch of the tree taken when the Moon is at full, and bound to the wriſt of a Womans arme, whoſe courſes come down too much, doth ſtay them in ſhort ſpace. The bark of the root killeth the broad worms in the bodies of men or children. The leaves of the vine of the early Fig, and of the Mulberry boyled in Rain water is good to waſh the hair, and to make it have a clear and fair co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. The ripe berries if they be taken before meat, do make paſſage for what followeth; but if after meat, and paſſe not quickly away, they corrupt in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and draw the reſt on to putrifaction with them, otherwiſe they trouble lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. There be growing upon the Cods, and about the Breech of ſome people certain tumors like unto Mulberries, which the powder of thoſe berries and leaves doth cure by Signature. The leaves of this tree, are the moſt natural food of Silk worms, as you may gather by what hath gone before: of which there might be great profit made here as, well as in <hi>Italy, Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> if we had been as induſtrious as they in nurſing up theſe kinds of trees; but it is not too late to learn any thing that may make for the attainment of nationall and private profit and riches.

It provoketh Womens Courſes, and the Hemorrhoides or Piles, but hardly draweth humours from any part above the Liver. Being outwardly applyed, it hath a conſolidating faculty to heal green wounds, and dryeth: as alſo mundifieth or cleanſeth, and takes away all putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in wounds. It healeth wounds of the Teſticles and Privities: it cures the redneſs of the Eys, and conſumes the ſpots growing therein. It is good in the Inflammations of the Eys, and Apoſtumes of the Lips, Noſe, and Eys. It healeth Ulcers that are hardly brought to cicatrize, and eſpecially thoſe in the Fundament and privy Members.

It is available in all cold Diſeaſes and Griefs, both of the Stomack and Body, diſſolving wind very powerfully, both upward and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The ſame alſo provoketh Urine, and helpeth to break the Stone, and expel Gravel from the Kidneys; it procureth Womens Courſes, and expelleth the dead Birth, and is ſingular good for the ſtrangling of the Mother, and other the like Womens Diſeaſes: it is effectuall alſo againſt the Dropſie, Cramp, and Fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

As firſt, it helpeth Children to breed their Teeth, their Gums being rubbed therewith; and to that purpoſe they have it faſtened at the ends of their Whiſtles: it faſtneth the Teeth alſo, that are looſe, and maketh them white; it helpeth ſore Gums, and Ulcers in the mouth, and healeth up foul hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Ulcers in other parts, and filleth them with fleſh, and is uſed in Medicines for the Eys, to ſtay the Flux of Rheum, and takes away the heat and redneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by cooling and drying up the moyſture; and ſome hang it about the neck of ſuch as have the Falling-Sickneſſe. The colour of red Corall holds forth by its Signature, that it ſtoppeth bleeding, which it doth, if it be but held in the hands of thoſe that bleed, either at the Noſe or Mouth: it is commended alſo, to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry effectuall for thoſe that ſpit blood, or be troubled with any other Flux of blood, either in Man or Woman; and being often taken in Wine, or other drink, doth diminiſh the Spleen; it helpeth alſo the Gonorrhea in Men, and the Whites in Women: It likewiſe helpeth them much that are troubled with the ſtopping of their water, or that make it by drops, and alſo thoſe that have the tormenting pains of the Stone in the Bladder, if the Powder when it is burnt be taken in drink. It ſtrengtheneth the Heart, Stomack, and Liver, and is therefore very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the Peſtilence, againſt venome, and all peſtilent Feavers, and malignant Diſeaſes; it chears the heart, and is good againſt melancholy. The Powder taken in Wine, or diſtilled water, brings reſt to ſuch as have Agues, and is good for them that are troubled with the Cramp. As it is commended in the Falling Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: ſo likewiſe it is ſaid to prevent it, if a Child ſo ſoon as it is born, take ten grains thereof, in Black-Cherry-water, or in the Mothers Milk. Some affirm, that it cauſeth an eaſie delivery of the birth, which it do, it muſt be by ſome ſpecifick Vertue; for experience doth manifeſt it, to be of a binding nature.

                  <p>The Husk wherein the ſeed of Henbane is contained, is in figure like to a Jaw Tooth; and therefore the Oyl of it, or the Juyce by it ſelf, or the Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the root with Arſmart in vinegar, being gargled warm in the mouth, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry effectuall in eaſing the pains of the Teeth. The leaves of Henbane do cool all hot Inflammations in the Eyes, or any other part of the body: and are to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage all manner of Swellings of the Cods or Womens Breaſts, or elſewhere, if they be boyled in Wine, and applyed either themſelvs, or the Fomentation, warm; it alſo aſſwageth the pain of the Gout, Sciatica, and all other pains in the Joynts, which ariſe from an hot cauſe. And applyed with vinegar to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head and Temples, helpeth the Headach, and want of ſleep in hot Feavers. The Oyl of the Seed is helpful for the Deafneſſe, Noiſe and Worms in the Ears, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dropped therein; and the Juyce of the Herb or Root doth the ſame. The Decoction of the Herb or Seed, or both killeth Lice in Man and Beaſt; the ſume of the dryed Herb, Stalks and Seed burned, quickly healeth Swellings, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blains or Kibes, in the hands or feet, by holding them in the ſmoak thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burnt, which will alſo make Hens to fall down from their rooſting place, as though they were dead. The white only is fit to be taken inwardly, which is moſt available to many good purpoſes, if it be wiſely and conveniently applyed, but the other ſort are accounted dangerous; and therefore not to be uſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, unleſſe in caſe of neceſſity, when the white cannot be had: But if at any time any one ſhould wittingly, or unwittingly take Henbane and be diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered thereby, the Remedy is to drink Goats Milk, Honyed Water, or Pine ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels with ſweet Wine; or in the abſence of theſe Fennel Seed, Nettle Seed, the Seed of Creſſes, Muſtard, or Radiſh; as alſo Onyons or Garlick taken in Wine, do all help to free them from danger, and reſtore them to their right temper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Though the plant uſed, as aforeſaid be effectual for the Toothach, yet I cannot commend the way of receiving the fume of the Seed into the mouth by holding it over a Chafingdiſh of Coales, it being but a meer Cheat; beſides, it may produce dangerous effects, intoxicating the head and troubling the ſight. The root being eaten cauſeth great drought, ſtoppage of Urine, and many other Symptomes, as you gather from the ſtory Mr. <hi>Parkinſon</hi> relates concerning a friend of his, who eat the roots of Henbane inſtead of Parſneps, to whoſe book I refer you.</p>

The Seed incloſed in thoſe Heads, is ſmall and ſhining, while it is freſh, very like unto Fleas, both for colour and bigneſſe; but turning black, when it groweth old.

It is a ſingular Remedy for green Wounds, to conſolidate their lips ſpeedily together; either the green Leaves bruiſed and applyed of themſelves, or the juyce of them, or a Salve made of the green Herbs ſtamped, or the juyce boyled with Hogs-lard, or with Sallet-Oyl and Wax, and ſome Turpentine added unto it; which is ſo ſoveraign a Salve for all manner of wounds and Sores, that the <hi>Germans</hi> uſe it exceeding much and extoll it beyond all other Salves, made of a ſimple Herb: They likewiſe uſe it for inward wounds or hurts, being boyled, either by it ſelf, or with other Wound-Herbs, as <hi>Comfry, Burnet, Moſ-eare,</hi> &amp;c. wherewith they uſe to heal, whomſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is wounded, either in the Body or Bowels or any other part, by giving them to drink of ſuch a decoction. The Herb boyled in Wine, or water, and thereof given to drink, to them that have any inward Ulcers in the Kidneys, or neck of the Bladder, doth wonderfully help them: It ſtayeth alſo all Fluxes, whether of blood; or of humours, as the Lask, Bloody Fluxes, or Womens too abundant Courſes: as alſo the bleeding of wounds, and both taketh away Inflammation, riſing upon the pains of the heart, and hindereth any to ariſe, being preſently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed after the hurt received: It is no leſſe helpful for foul Ulcers, hard to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: as alſo for Cancers and Fiſtulaes. The diſtilled water of the Herb, doth ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually perform the ſame things; and ſome keep the dryed Herb to uſe in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions, or made into powder to drink, as often as they ſhall have occaſion.</p>

                  <p>The white Archangel (which is moſt pertiment for the preſent occaſion) hath divers ſquare ſtalks, about a foot high, not ſtanding ſtraight upright, but leaning downwards towards the ground, by reaſon of the great weight of its ponderous Leaves (as ſome conceive, though I do not) which are in ſhape like thoſe of the ſtinging Nettles, nicked about the edges; yet not ſtinging at all, but ſoft, and as it were downy: At the joynts with the Leaves ſtand large, and open-gaping white Flowers in husks, round about the ſtalks, faſhioned like to little gaping Hoods or Helmets: in which there is many times a ſweet, honyiſh moyſture, as may be perceived, if you ſuck them, as many times you ſhall ſee Children and Bees do: in the Husks, after the Flowers are fallen, ſtand ſmall, roundiſh black Seeds: The Root is white, with many Fibres thereat, not growing downwards, but lying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the upper cruſt of the Earth, ſpreading and increaſing like unto Couch-graſſe, which abideth many years ſtill increaſing.</p>

The <hi>Italians,</hi> with whom it is in greater eſteem then with us, call it <hi>Aralda,</hi> and have an uſuall Proverb with them concerning it, which is, <hi>Aralda tutte Piaghe ſalda, Aralda</hi> ſalveth all Sores; for they uſe it familiarly to heal any freſh or green wound, or cut the Leaves, being but bruiſed, and bound to; and ſometimes alſo they uſe the juyce of it in old Sores, to cleanſe them, dry up their moyſture, and heal them the more ſpeedily, which it performeth by the bitter quality therein. But the Reaſon why I treat of it in this place is, becauſe it hath been by later experience, found to be very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable for the Kings Evill, the Flowers being ſtamped together with freſh But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and applyed to the place; or if the Flowers cannot be had, the Leaves bruiſed and applyed, or the juyce made up into an Oyntment, and uſed thereon, worketh the ſame effect, though not altogether ſo powerfully.

Mr. <hi>Culpeper</hi> ſaith, that if you pleaſe to make the Juyce thereof into a Syrup, with Honey or Sugar,, you may take a ſpoonful or two at a time for a Quinſy, and you ſhall find the medicine more pleaſant, and the Cure more ſpeedy then if you took a Dogs Turd, which is the Learned Colledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es vulgar cure. This may be a good remedy: but if Mr. <hi>Culpeper</hi> had been ſo wiſe, as to have known the goodneſſe of a Dogs Turd for this purpoſe: he would not have belched it forth ſo opprobriouſly in diſparagement of the Colledge; whom I know not for what cauſe, he takes occaſion many times to inveigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, where there is none. But to return to Orpine: It is ſeldom uſed (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Mr. <hi>Culpepers</hi> Syrup) in inward medicines with us; but <hi>Tragus</hi> ſaith, and that from experience, that in <hi>Germany</hi> the diſtilled water thereof is uſed for gnawings or excoriations in the Stomach or Bowels, and for Ulcers in the Lungs, Liver, or other inward parts; as alſo in the Matrix, and helpeth all thoſe diſeaſes, being drunk for certain daies together, and that it ſtayeth the ſharpneſſe of the humours, in the bloody flux, and other fluxes in the belly, or in wounds. The Root thereof alſo performeth the ſame effect. It is uſed outwardly to cool any heat or Inflammation upon any hurt or wound, and eaſeth the paines of them: as alſo to heal Scaldings and Burnings: the Juyce thereof beaten with ſome Sallet Oyl and anointed, The leaf alſo bruiſed, and laid to any green wound in the hands or Leggs doth heal them. The root helpeth Ruptures and Burſtneſſe by Signature; the tuberous and glandulous Cloggs being not much unlike thoſe hard ſwellings, or falling down of the Cuts into the Cods.</p>

The Decoction of the herb with a little honey added thereto, is good to gargle a fore throat, and being drunk without honey, it eaſeth the paines of the Muther, and bringeth down Womens Courſes; it alſo eaſeth thoſe grieſs that ariſe from obſtructions of the Liver, Spleen and Reins: the juyce held in the mouth eaſeth the Tooth-ach; and three ounces thereof taken at a time doth wonderfully help the ſtopping of the Urine; and to expell the Stone or Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yel in the Kidneys or Bladder; and is therefore put among herbs, uſed in Clyſters to mitigate pains in the Back, Sides, or Bowells proceeding of wind, ſtopping of Urine, the Gravel or Stone as aforeſaid.

It hath many rowes of Corns in the Eare, which are incloſed in the Husks, having not that skin on them, that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath, being lank, ſmall, yellow, and ſhort, almoſt like Wheat, but leſſe. The ſtalks are like unto the common Barly, ſaving that it hath not ſo many ſtalks, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the Roots; ſo that though the one have ſix rowes, yet the other hath thirty or forty ſtalks to countervail them.</p>

                  <head>The Vertues.</head>
                  <p>Garlick being eaten, heateth the Body, maketh thin, thick, and groſſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; cutteth ſuch as are tough, and clammy, digeſteth and conſumeth them: it alſo openeth Obſtructions or ſtoppings, and is an enemy to cold poyſon, and to the biting of venomous Beaſts. It taketh away the roughneſſe of the Throat, alſo helpeth an old Cough, provoketh Urine, killeth Worms, expelleth Wind, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Cholick, cures the Dropſie proceeding of a cold Cauſe, provoketh the Courſes in Women, and ſtirreth up <hi>Venus</hi> and Luſt, but dryeth the Seed of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and is moſt excellent for a cold and moyſt ſtomach, and to ſtir up naturall heat. An old Man by lying in the cold in the Winter ſeaſon, had almoſt loſt the innate or naturall heat of his ſtomach, and his appetite was even decayed, after many hot Medicines uſed in vain, at length was cured with Garlick and Honey. It is a good preſervative againſt the contagious and peſtilent Air. A Decoction thereof made with <hi>Origanum,</hi> and Wine, being drunk, killeth Worm-Lice, and Nits. It is profitable againſt the biting of a mad Dog, and for ſuch as are inclined to the Palſie, for ſhortneſſe of breath, and to dry up Rheum; and alſo for the cold Head-ach. It is commended againſt the Conſumption of the Lungs, piſſing of blood, and for ſuch as cannot hold their water. The diſtilled water is good for
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:52711:79"/> the ſame Diſeaſes, and for the Quinſie. The milk wherein Garlick hath been boyled, is good for worms in Children, or two Ounces of the water may be given morning and evening for a week together, if need be. The Decoction thereof uſed for a Bath, or Fume to ſit over, brings down the Flowers and after-Birth. It cureth the bitings of mad Dogs, or the bitings of any other venomous Creature: being bruiſed with Rue, and applyed, it taketh away the Morphew, Tetters, and cures ſcabbed Heads in Children, Dandraffe and Scurf, tempered with Honey, and the parts anointed therewith. The aſhes of Garlick being ſtrowed in Ulcers, healeth them. The ſmell of Garlick driveth away venomous Creatures, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with Figs, and Cummin, it cures the bitings of the Mouſe called a Shrew. A Clove of Garlick put into an hollow Tooth that aketh, eaſeth the pain thereof, or ſtamp it with Saffron or Pepper, and hold it between the Teeth; being bruiſed, and applyed to the Throat, it helpeth the Quinſey, and ſwelling thereof. The juyce mixed with Saffron and Gooſe-greaſe, cures the noyſe of the Ears, being put therein. Garlick burned, and the aſhes mingled with Honey, and layd to black and blew marks after bruiſes, taketh them away, and helpeth wild-fire and Scabs, being bruiſed and applyed. They uſually cure the Pip in Poultry with Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; and being given to Cocks, it maketh them to overcome in fighting. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all theſe Vertues, raw Garlick eaten too liberally, maketh the Eyes dim, offendeth and hurteth the ſtomack, cauſeth thirſt, hurteth the Kidneys, heateth and burneth the blood, yieldeth no nouriſhment to the body, and is hurtful to young men, and to ſuch as are hot, and cholerick, and in hot ſeaſons: It hurteth Women with Child, and ſuch as give ſuck. The juyce of Garlick, if it be taken in any great quantity, is ranck poyſon: yet the fleſh, and all being eaten together moderately, is good for ſuch as are cold and moyſt, and abound with flegmatick, groſſe, and tough humours, for old perſons, and in cold ſeaſons. The beſt way of preparing it for food, is to boyl it throughly, and to eat it with Oyl, Vinegar, or ſuch like.</p>

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:52711:81"/> and are both of ſundry colours, of ſeveral ſizes, and ripening at contrary times of the year: as alſo with thicker or thinner skins that cover them. Thoſe that are moſt ordinary are white, and of a reaſonable bigneſſe.</p>

Figs ſtamped with ſalt, Rue, and the kernels of Nuts, withſtand Poyſon and corruption of the Air. They are beſt faſting, or when the Stomach is empty. Toaſted Figs are good for women to haſten, and facilitate the Birth. Figs bruiſed and applyed with Barly Meal, and the powder of <hi>Fennygreek</hi> ſeed do mollify the hard tumours and Kernells under the Throat and Ears, and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where by Signature; as alſo the hardneſſe of the Muther; and if ſome Leaven and Salt be put to them, it breaketh Plague ſores; and, it may be, was the ſame that cured <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> They are alſo mixed with Copperas againſt old ſores of the Legs, and all other foul running Ulcers: being boyled in Wine with Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, and then applyed with Barly Meal to the bellies of them that have a Dropſie, helpeth them very much; and beaten with Salt applyed, taketh away the Itch and Scab, and the aſhes of the wood made up with Hogs Greaſe and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, healeth Kibes and Chilblaines. Figs bruiſed with Fennygreek, and Vinegar eaſeth the Hot Gout of the Feet. A Fig, ſlit and toaſted, doth oftentimes eaſe the Tooth-ach being applyed. The milk that iſſueth out from the Leaves or Branches when they are broken off being dropped upon Warts, takes them away. The decoction of Fig Leaves doth alſo avail much to do away any other malady

A Syrup made of Fig leaves taken inwardly, diſſolves congealed Blood cauſed by bruiſes or falls, and helps the bloody Flux; An oyntment made of the Juyce of Hogs greaſe, is as excellent a Remedy for the biting of a mad Dog, or any venemous Creature, as any is. A Syrup made of the leaves or green fruit, is excellent good for Coughs, Hoarſeneſs or ſhortneſſe of Breath, and all diſeaſes of the Breaſt and Lungs.

It is much commended alſo, to help Aches and pains, either in the fleſhy parts, or in the Nerve and Sinews: as alſo the Sciatica, or pain of the Hips, or Huckle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, to bathe the places with the decoction of the Herb, or to anoint them with an Oyntment made of the Herb, bruiſed and boyled in old Hogs-Suet, with ſome Maſtick and Olibanum in Powder, added unto it, after it is ſtrained forth, and not before; for otherwiſe it would be to little or no purpoſe. It is held alſo to be a certain remedy to help the Staggers in Horſes, and upon that account, ſome call it Stagger-wort, and indeed it is not without a Signature thereof: the unevenneſſe of the edges of the Leaves, being like unto thoſe uneven motions which Horſes make in that Diſeaſe.</p>

It is uſed alſo by women in Childbed after their ſore travel, for it helpeth Throws and after-paines, if you give two or three drachms of it to Children that are newly born and troubled with gripings, mingling Sugar Pellets or white, Sugar Candy therewith, it will much avail. The ſweet Almonds them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves yeeld good and plentiful nouriſhment to the body; therefore they are good for weak and macerated perſons, or ſuch as are lean.

Being blanched and dryed that they may be made in powder, which taken by it ſelf or with other things, ſtayeth the looſeneſs of the belly. Bitter Almonds open the ſtoppings of the Liver and Spleen, cleanſe the Lungs from groſſe tough phlegme, cleanſe the Kidnyes and provoke Urine. They take away flatulent or windy humours in the body, and provoke the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in Women. Being taken with <hi>Amylum</hi> or Starch, and Mints, they are good againſt ſpitting of Blood; and taken with water they are good for paines in the back, and the Inflammation of the Lungs. They preſerve from drunkenneſſe if five or ſix be eaten in a morning faſting. The Oyl of bitter Almonds being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken killeth Worms, helpeth the paines, Suffocations and tortions of the Womb. Being drunken with wine it mitigateth the Cough, and brings away the ſtone or gravel in the kidnyes.

If the Temples be anointed therewith, it eaſeth the paines of the head and brings reſt; or boyl bitter Almonds with vinegar of Roſes, and Roſe Leaves and apply it to the Temples. Being bruiſed with Hony they are good againſt the biting of a mad dog. The powder of the Almond Cakes after the Oyl is preſſed from them, doth cleanſe the hands or skin in any place better then Sope.

The Manured Vine. 2. The Vine with thin cut Leaves, like Parſley, which is a manured Vine; but differeth from the former in the Leaf. 3. The wild Vine of <hi>Europe.</hi> 4. The wild Vine of <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi> 5. The wild Vine of <hi>Canada.</hi> The chiefeſt Grapes are, 1.

The <hi>Curran</hi> Grape, which dryed, are thoſe the Grocers ſell. 7. The ſmall early black Grape. 8. The black Grape of <hi>Orleance.</hi> 9. The Grape without ſtones.

                  <head>The Forme.</head>
                  <p>The manured Vine, in places where it hath ſtood long, and thrived, hath a great ſtem, as big as ones Arm, ſleeve and all, ſpreadding without end or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, if it be ſuffered, many ſlender weak branches, that muſt be ſuſtained from falling down, the young being red, and the old of a dark colour, with a pith in the middle; at the ſundry joynts whereof, grow ſeverall large, broad, green Leaves, cut into five Diviſions, and dented alſo about the edges, at the joynts, likewiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Leaves come forth long twining tendrells, claſping or winding about whatſoever it may take hold of: at the bottoms of the Leaves, come forth cluſters
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:52711:90"/> of ſmall greeniſh, yellow Flowers; and after them Berries, thick ſet together in bunches of ſeverall forms, greatneſſe, colour, and taſt; in ſome, the cluſters are cloſe in others more open; ſome round, others long, and ſome tending to a ſquare: ſome likewiſe are very ſmall, as the Currah Grape; others great, and ſome a mean between both: ſome again are white, others black or blewiſh, or red or particoloured: within which there are uſually one, two, or three kernels; for taſt, ſome ſweet, ſome ſowre, ſome mixt according to the Clymate wherein they grow. They that keep their Vines in the beſt manner, do keep them low, and cut them often, both Winter and Summer: yet if they be pruned later then <hi>February,</hi> they looſe their nouriſhment with weeping; but in <hi>October</hi> and <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> is the beſt time, and being thus dreſſed, they grow better, take up leſſe room, bringing their Grapes, both fairer and ſweeter.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Places and Time.</head>
                  <p>It is true, that manured Vines are planted every where; but there is much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in what Soil and Climate they grow; for though the Vine that groweth in the <hi>Canary</hi> Iſlands, is the ſame with that at <hi>Malaga</hi> and <hi>Sheris,</hi> yet the one ſtill excelleth the other, in ſweetneſſe and ſtrength. And though many of our Vines be of the ſame kind with thoſe in <hi>France,</hi> yet they ſeldom come to maturity, to make ſo good Wine as theirs, our Country being colder: however, I have heard of Wine made in <hi>England,</hi> of Grapes, growing in Mrs. <hi>Pits</hi> Garden at <hi>Harrow</hi> on the Hill. But the Vine which is thought fitteſt for our Clymate, is the Parſley Vine which bears abundance of fruits to perfection. The Fox Grape, and the red and white Muſcadine Grape ſet againſt the South, and well ordered, bear ſtore of good fruit. They are not ripe here, till <hi>September,</hi> but ſooner in the hotter Countries. The Raiſin of the Sun-Vine, groweth as I ſuppoſe in <hi>Spain,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Damaſcus</hi> and <hi>Smyrna;</hi> for thence are they brought into theſe parts, and therefore ſo called. The Vine that beareth Currans, groweth about <hi>Corinth,</hi> and therefore they are called <hi>Uvae Corinthiacae,</hi> and in the Iſle of <hi>Lante.</hi> The wild Vine of <hi>Europe,</hi> groweth in many places of <hi>Italy, France,</hi> and <hi>Germany:</hi> the other wild ſorts are expreſſed in their Titles. Theſe wild ſorts flowre later then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and their fruit is ripe later.</p>

The tender and claſping Branches of the Vine, and the Leaves do cool and mightily bind. And as Grapes are divers in taſt, ſo they are in quality; for ſoure Grapes are cold and moyſt; and ſweet Grapes are hot and moyſt.

                  <p>The Sugar Cane is a pleaſant and profitable Reed, having long ſtalks ſeaven or eight foot high, joynted and knee'd like the common walking Canes, but that the Leaves come forth of every joynt on every ſide of the ſtalk one, like unto wings long narrow and ſharp pointed. The Cane it ſelf or ſtalk is not hollow as the other Canes and Reeds are; but full and ſtuffed with a ſpungious ſubſtance, in taſte exceeding ſweet. The root is great and long creeping along within the inner cruſt of the earth, which is likewiſe ſweet and pleaſant, but leſſe hard or wooddy then other Canes or Reeds; from which do ſhoot many young Cions which are cut away from the main or Mother plant; becauſe they ſhould not draw away the nouriſhment from the old ſtock; and ſo get unto themſelves a little moiſture, or elſe ſome ſubſtance not much worth, and cauſe the ſtock to be barren, and themſelves little the better: which ſhoots do ſerve for plants to ſet abroad for increaſe.</p>

                  <p>Sugar is good to make ſmooth the roughneſſe of the breaſt and Lungs, cleareth the voice and putteth away hoarſneſs and the Cough; and ſo doth Sugar Candy. It is convenient for the Stomach, helpeth the roughneſſe and dryneſſe of the mouth and throat, alſo thirſt and drought in Feaverse, ſpecially being mixed with water and ſo taken, and it is very profitable for the Reins and Bladder. It is uſed to put ſowreneſſe, and bitterneſſe out of the mouth of ſick perſons, and may be put into cooling as well as heating and warming Medicines. Sugar or White Sugar Candy, put into the Eye, taketh away the dimneſſe, and the blood ſhot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten therein: It is good to be put into green wounds whilſt they are yet bleeding and ſtrewed into foul ſores, it cleanſeth them. This is the Phyſical uſe of Sugar, which hath obtained now a daies ſo continuall and daily uſe; that it is almoſt accounted not Phyſicall, and is more commonly uſed in Confections, Syrups, and ſuch like; as alſo preſerving, and conſerving ſundry fruits, as Cherries, Damſons, Mulberries, &amp;c. and Flowers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Roſes, Violets, Roſemary Flowers and ſuch like, which ſtill retain with them the Name of Sugar, as Sugar Roſet, Sugar Violet, &amp;c. to write of all which, is beſides our Intentions. Now for our ordinary Reeds; The roots, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, have a cleanſing quality, but not ſharp; and the Leaves alſo. The freſh Leaves bruiſed, or the roots applyed to thoſe places that have Thorns, Splinters, or the like in the fleſh do draw them forth in a ſhort ſpace the ſame alſo applyed with Vinegar, helpeth Members out of joynt by Signature and eaſeth the pains in the Loins: the freſh leaves alſo, bruiſed and applyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hot Impoſtumes, Inflammations, or St. <hi>Anthonies</hi> ſire eaſeth them; the Aſhes made of the outer rind of the ſtalk, mingled with Vinegar, helpeth the falling off the hair. If the flower or woolly ſubſtance happen into the ears, it ſticketh therein ſo faſt, as that by no means it will be gotten forth again, but will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure deafneſſe withal. Some have obſerved that the Fern and the Reed are at perpetuall enmity, the one not abiding where the other is: which may b,e as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> ſaith, not becauſe of any Antipathy in the plants; but becauſe they draw a like nouriſhment, and ſo ſtarve one the other; whereas there is ſuch amity they ſay, between Aſparagus and the Reed, that they both thrive wondrous well, which is becauſe they draw a different Juyce.

The Decoction of the Herb and Roots applyed, doth help all ſorts of cold tumours, or ſwellings, in any part of the Body; and is alſo as effectuall for any ſhrunk Sinew or Vein in any place. The Juyce made up with the Powder of <hi>Borax</hi> and <hi>Camphor,</hi> doth cleanſe the skin of the face, or other part of the Body, as Freckles, Pimples, Morphew, and Lepry. The ſame decoction helpeth the Redneſſe and Spots in the white of the Eyes, uſed either by it ſelf, or with the Juyce of Fennel. The Head waſhed with the ſame Decoction, cleanſeth it from Dandraffe, Scurf, Scabs, Sores, Itches, and the like, being uſed warm. Tents alſo dipped in the Juyce, or water thereof, doth heal all green Wounds, old Sores and Ulcers. The Herb bruiſed, and applyed, doth looſen, ſplinter, broken Bone, Arrow Head, or other ſuch like thing lying in the fleſh, and cauſeth it eaſily to be drawn forth.</p>

                  <p>The Decoction of Coleworts being mingled with hony and drunk recovereth hoarſeneſſe or loſſe of the Voice, the leaves themſelves help thoſe that are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into a Conſumption, if they uſe to eat them well boyled, and often. The pulpe of the middle ribs of Coleworts, boyled in Almond-milk, and made up into an Electuary with hony, is very profitably uſed, by thoſe that are ſhortwind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and purify if they often take thereof. Being boyled twice, and an old cock boyled in the broth and drunk, it helpeth the pains and obſtructions of the Liver and Spleen, and the ſtone in the Kidnies. The juyce boyled with honey, and dropped into the Corner of the Eye, cleareth the ſight by conſuming any filme or cloud beginning to dimme it; it alſo conſumeth the Canker growing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. They are much commended being eaten before meat to keep one from ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting, as alſo from being drunk with too much wine, or quickly make a man ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that is drunk before. Being gently boyled in broth and eaten, they open the body, but the ſecond decoction bindeth. The juyce thereof drunk in wine helpeth thoſe that are bitten by an Adder; and the decoction of the flowers bringeth down Womens Courſes. The decoction of Coleworts taketh away the pain and ach, and allayeth the ſwellings of ſwoln, and gowty Leggs and Knees, wherein many groſſe and watery humours are fallen, the place being bathed therewith warm: It helpeth alſo old and filthy ſores being bathed therewith, and healeth all ſmall ſcabs, puſhes and wheals that break out in the skin. The aſhes of Colewort ſtalks mixed with old Hogs Greaſe, is very effectual to anoint the ſides of thoſe that have had long paines therein, or any other place pained with Melancholly and windy humours, helping mightily to digeſt them: It is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the old <hi>Romans</hi> having expelled Phyſitians out of their territories, did for ſix hundred years preſerve their health, and helped their infirmities, by uſing &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying it for their only medicine in every diſeaſe &amp; <hi>Chryſippus</hi> affirmeth as much in his book concerning it. The broth or firſt decoction of the Sea Colewort like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe doth by the ſharp nitrous and bitter qualities therein, open the belly and purgeth the body (but the ſecond decoction both of this and the former alſo, is ſaid to bind the body) yet, as <hi>Galen</hi> thinketh, not without ſome hurt thereto; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as he ſaith, it much varieth from the Temperature of our body, being hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and dryer then the Garden kinds; and therefore as all other wild herbs are
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:52711:96"/> ſtronger in operation, and ſo this cleanſeth and digeſteth more powerfully then they. The Leaves while they are young although bitter, being boyled (in Lye ſaith <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> but in fair water is moſt uſuall with us in theſe daies) are eaten as other Coleworts are by divers poor people neer the Sea, the boyling taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way much of the bitterneſſe thereof; the ſeed hereof bruiſed and drunk killeth worms, the leaves or the Juyce of them applyed to ſores or ulcers cleanſeth and healeth them, and diſſolveth tumours and ſwellings, and taketh away the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations.</p>

                  <p>The roots or Leaves of nettles boyled or the Juyce of either of them or both made into an electuary, with hony or Sugar is ſafe and ſure medicine, to open the Pipes and Paſſages of the Lungs, which is the cauſe of wheeſing and ſhortneſſe of breath, and helpeth to expectorate tough flegme, as alſo to raiſe the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtumated Pluriſie and ſpend it by ſpitting: the ſame helpeth the ſwelling of the Almonds of the Throat, the Mouth and Throat, being gargled therewith. The juyce is alſo effectual to ſettle the Palate of the mouth in its place, and to heal and temper the inflammations and ſoreneſſe of the Mouth and Throat. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of the leaves in wine being drunk, is ſingular good to provoke Womens Courſes, and ſettle the ſuffocation or ſtrangling of the Muther, and all other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes thereof, as alſo applyed outwardly with a little Myrrh. The ſame alſo or the ſeed provoketh Urine, and expelleth the Gravel or Stone in the Reins or Bladder as hath been often and effectually proved in many that have taken it. The ſame killeth the Worms in Children, eaſeth pains in the ſides and diſſolveth the windineſſe in the Spleen, as alſo in the body, although others think it to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke Venery, which it may be ſaid to do by Signature. The Juyce of the Leaves taken two or three daies together, ſtayeth bleeding at the mouth. The ſeed being drunk, is a remedy againſt the ſtinging of venemous Creatures, the biting of mad Dogs, the poyſonous qualities of Hemlock, Henbane, Nightſhade; Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drak, or other ſuch like herbs that ſtupifie and dull the ſences; as alſo the Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy eſpecially to uſe it outwardly to rub the Forehead or Templs in the Lethargy and the places bitten or ſtung with beaſts, with a little Salt.

The ſame applyed to wearied members refreſh them, or to places that have been out of joynt being firſt ſet again, ſtrengthning, drying, and comforting them, as alſo thoſe places that are troubled with Aches and Gouts, and the defluxions of humours upon the joynts or Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news, it eaſeth the paines, and dryeth or diſſolveth the defluxions. An oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made of the juyce, oyl, and a little wax, is ſingular good to rub cold benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Members, to bring them to their proper activity again. An handful of the green Leaves of Nettles, and another of Wallwort or Danewort, bruiſed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed ſimply of themſelvs to the Gout, Sciatica, or Joynt-Aches in any part hath been found to be an admirable help thereunto. It is ſaid that if green Nettles be put into the Urine of a ſick body, if it be freſh and green after it hath lyen four and twenty hours therein, the party ſhall recover of that ſickneſſe, but if it do not abide green, it ſignifieth death or danger. It is ſaid, likewiſe that if the Juyce of the roots of Nettles, be mixed with Ale or Beer, and given to one that is ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to have loſt her maidenhead, if it remain with her ſhe is a maid, otherwiſe not. If you give Hens ſome dry Nettles broken ſmall with their meat in Winter it will make them lay eggs all the Winter more plentifully, It is ſaid alſo that if the herb be rubbed on the privities of female beaſts that will not ſuffer the males to cover them; it will cauſe them the more willingly to ſuffer them to do it. The oyl of Roſes, or Sallet Oyl boyled with the juyce, or the juyce of the Leaves themſelves, is a preſent Remedy to take away the ſtinging of Nettles: To all the purpoſes aforeſaid, the Roman Nettle is held the moſt effectual; yet where it cannot be had, the others are in a degree next it, as effectual. Nettle tops are uſually boyled in Pottage in the Spring time, to conſume the Phlegmatick ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities in the body of Man, that the coldneſſe and moiſture of the Winter hath left behind.</p>

                  <p>Although Mallowes are commonly ſaid to mollifie the belly and make it ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble, yet there are other things more effectuall to that purpoſe; I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore appropriate it to the Breaſts or Paps of women: for it not onely procureth great ſtore of Milk in the Breaſts of thoſe Nurſes that eare it, being boyled and buttered, as other herbes commonly, are or ſhred into their pottage; but alſo aſſwageth the hardneſſe of them, being boyled and applyed unto them warme: as alſo all other hard Tumors, Inflammations of Impoſtums, and ſwelling of Cods, and other parts, and eaſeth the paines of them, and likewiſe the hardneſſe of the Liver and Spleen, being applyed to the places, eſpecially if a Pultis be made, by adding ſome Bean or Barly flower, or Oyle of Roſes to them. The Leaves and Roots alſo boyled in wine, or water, or in broth, with parſley or Fennell Roots; doth help to open the Body, and is very convenient in hot Agues, or other diſtempers of the body; for by its mollilying quality, it not onely voideth hot cholerick, or other offenſive humors; but eaſeth the paines and torments that come by the ſtoppings of the belly, and to that end the boyled leaves are apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed warm to the Belly, and it is uſed in Cliſters for the ſame purpoſe. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of the ſeed of any of the Common Mallowes made in milk or wine, doth marvellouſly help Excoriations of the Bowells, Ptiſick, Pleureſie, and other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the Cheſt and Lungs that proceed of hot cauſes, if it be continued taking for ſome time together; The Leaves and Roots work the ſame effects. The juice drunk in wine, or the Decoction made in wine, doth help women to an eaſy &amp; ſpeedy delivery. The Leaves bruiſed and laid to the Eys, with a little Hony, taketh away the Impoſtumation of them. The Leaves rubbed upon any place ſtung with Bees, Waſpes or the like, taketh away the pains, redneſſe &amp; ſwelling thereof. The juice of Mallows boyled in old Oyl, &amp; applyed, taketh away all roughneſſe of the skin, as alſo the falling of the haire, the Scurſe, Dandraffe, or Dry-Scabs, in the head, or other parts, if they be anointed therewith, or waſhed with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction: the ſame alſo is effectuall againſt Scaldings or Burnings, and to help wild-fire, and all other hot, red, and painfull ſwellings in any part of the body. The Flowers boyled in water and a little Honey added, is a good Gargle for any ſore mouth or throat: If the feet be bathed with the Decoction of the Leaves, Roots and Flowers, it helpeth the flowing down of Rhume from the head, which roſe out of the Stomack: the green leaves beaten with Nitre and applyed, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out thornes or pricks out of the fleſh.

But to me it is ſufficient, that I have for my Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that famous Herbariſt <hi>Spigelius,</hi> who in his ſecond Book, and fourth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, treating of thoſe things that generate Milk, ſaith, There are alſo ſome Herbs, as well hot as cold, which although they breed little blood, and are of ſmall nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment: yet they cauſe great plenty of milk, as Lettice, Cabbage, and Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winckle, which being boyled in water, or the Broth of Meat, doth recall the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Milk into the Breaſts, though they nouriſh little or nothing at all, which actions, they perform, rather by an occult ſpecifick vertue then any manifeſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. The other properties that it hath, are that it ſtayeth bleeding, both at Mouth and Noſe, if ſome of the Leaves be chewed, and the <hi>French</hi> do uſe it to ſtay their menſtruall Courſes. <hi>Dioſcorides, Galen,</hi> and <hi>Aegineta</hi> commend it againſt the Lasks and Fluxes of the Belly, to be drunk with Wine, and being chewed, it eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the pains of the Teeth.

Wine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is kept in a freſh Gourd all night, before it hath been cleanſed from the looſe inward pulpe and ſeed, and drunk in the morning, will cauſe the body to be ſoluble.

The ſaid water or Juyce being drunk or applyed outwardly to the privy Members of Man or Woman, reſtraineth the immoderate Luſt of the Body. The Aſhes of burnt Gourds are uſed of many to cleanſe and heal old ulcers and ſores, as well in the Genitories as other patts of the body, and to help ſcaldings or burnings by fire or water: they are accounted as good for macilent lean and weak bodies to feed on, as they are hurtful to ſuch as have the wind cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, to whom they are not to be given at any hand.

The whole Gourds are eaten in hot countries with much delight, kept and preſerved with great care, art and pains, to be ſpent almoſt all the year after; and have there a far more ſweet and pleaſant relliſh then in theſe colder Climates, where being more wateriſh they are more inſipid; they are eaten boyled or ſtewed, but much better being fryed, whereby they give the better nouriſhment to the body; for by their moiſture being boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or ſtewed they are the more Lubrick or ſlippery, and make the body more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble as they do being pickled up, as oftentimes they are beyond the Seas: yet with Us the fruit is ſeldom eaten any of theſe waies, by reaſon of its very wateriſh taſt, unleſſe it be that of the Simnel Gourd, which being of a firmer Subſtance, if it be well dreſſed, is an acceptable meat, and is no leſſe effectual in medicine.

Perhaps it may be hurtful to a weak brain, and cauſe the headach by reaſon of its ſtrong ſavour, yet by thoſe whoſe brains are ſtronger, it is as much eſteemed as any other ſweet ſmelling herb, to ſweeten or perform any thing, and held as effectual to comfort the brain, and likewiſe to open and purge the head. It is good for thoſe that are ſhort winded, provoketh Urine and the Terms in Women, and brings a ſpeedy deliverance to them in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. The ſeeds are uſed to help the trembling of the heart and to comfort the ſame, as alſo to expel Melancholy or ſadneſſe. A decoction of the herb made and taken, is good againſt poyſon and ſting of Scorpions, and helpful for thoſe that are given to ſwoonings, and it provokes Venery or Luſt, uſed with Oyl of Roſes, Myrtles and Vinegar, is good againſt the paines of the head, and it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably applyed to thoſe that are troubled with the Lethargy, the Jaundiſe and Dropſie. It is good to be put into the ears of young children With a little Gooſegreaſe to help them of the paines thereof; the juyce or ſeed bruiſed put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Noſtrils procureth ſneeſing. Mixed with honey and uſed, it taketh a way ſpots in the face. The Juyce put into the Eyes taketh away the dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof, and dryeth up humours that fall into them: ſo that as it ſeemes this herb applyed outwardly cures that which it cauſed being taken inwardly: for moſt Writers ſay that it dulleth the ſight, if it be eaten in any plentifull manner. I conceive that Hollerus relating the ſtory of the Italian, who by often ſmelling to Baſil had a Scorpion bred in his brain, miſtook the cauſe and that the Scorpion being there before he uſed to ſmell the Baſil, was then moſt quiet when he did ſo, for it is obſerved that ſcorpions are pleaſed with its ſmell, and ſo the Italian found it which made him uſe it ſo much, but being grown too big for that nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row compaſſe, he cauſed thoſe vehemenr and long paines whereof he dyed.</p>

                  <p>Engliſh Tobacco riſeth up with a thick round ſtalk, ſometime two foot high whereon do grow thick fat green leaves, nothing ſo large as the other Indian kinds, ſomewhat round pointed alſo, and nothing dented about the Edges.

The ſeed that followeth, is not very bright, but large, contained in great heads.

                  <p>The Leaves of this Herb have alſo the Signature of the Heart; and accordingly it is very much commended for the paſſions of the heart.

The Syrup of <hi>Baulm</hi> is likewiſe a good Cordiall, and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theneth the heart and ſtomach, reſiſteth Melancholy, and is very profitable in burning and contagious Feavers. A Cawdle made with the juyce hereof, while it is young: together, with Eggs, and ſome Roſe-water and Sugar put thereto, is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten given to Women in Child-bed, when the After-birth is not throughly avoided; and for their faintings upon, or after their ſore Travels.

The Flower groweth at the top, of a yellowiſh white colour, with a yellow Crown, or Circle in the middle. The Root is white, and of a Bulbus or Onyon faſhion, yet not without divers effects by which it is propagated.</p>

It is alſo very uſeful, when the ſtomack is not able to perform the Office of digeſtion, or when the appetite hath any need of provocation, and likewiſe for the ſuppreſſing of vomiting, when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them proceed of a cold cauſe, if ſo be it be only chewed in the mouth, and ſo it draweth forth watery and flegmatick humours, both from the Head and Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack. It is in like manner profitable againſt the Falling-ſickneſs, the Sciatica, the Cough, reſolutions of the Sinews, Ruptures, pains of the Belly, killing of Worms, and provoking Urine, being drunk with Sack; and ſo it not only comforteth and warmeth the weak, cold, and feeble ſtomack, but helpeth the Ague, and riddeth the ſhaking fits. A dram of Cardamome-Seed, drunk in Wine, with as much Bark of Laurel, breaketh the Stone, and being mixed with Ale, wherein Time and Parſley have been boyled, and then ſtrained, it is a good remedy for the Chollick. It is a good Spice for Women, that are troubled with any grief, particularly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to that Sex. It provoketh Urine, when it is ſtopped, or paſſeth with pain, reſiſteth poyſon, and the ſting of Scorpions, and other venomous Creatures. It ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelleth Wind powerfully from other entralls, as well as the ſtomack, eaſeth thoſe that by falls or beatings, are bruiſed and broken, and thoſe that are tormented with the Sciatica or Hip-Gout; and being boyled in Vinegar, or ſleeped therein and uſed, it is good againſt Scabs and Tetters. The Powder of it put into the noſe comforteth the feeble brain; or if it be put with the Oyl of Musk, in an Egge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhell, till it boyl, and then anointed therewith. It is ſaid by ſome, to be the chief of all Seeds.</p>

                  <p>IT is more then probable that this Plant was not known to the ancient Greek writers ſeeing there is no Greek name for it, that we can learne. It is called <hi>Ribes</hi> and <hi>Ribeſius frutex</hi> from ſome Analogy it hath, both in reſpect of the ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and alſo in the properties with the <hi>Ribes</hi> of <hi>Serapio,</hi> and not that it is the ſame. <hi>Geſner,</hi> calleth it <hi>Ceanothus levis,</hi> but it is accounted by divers to be a kind of <hi>Groſſularia,</hi> who therefore call it <hi>Groſſularia Rubra,</hi> &amp; <hi>Groſſularia ultramarina. Bauhinus</hi> calleth the white ſort <hi>Groſſularia hortenſis margaritis ſimilis.</hi> The black ſort is generally called <hi>Ribes fructu nigro,</hi> in Engliſh <hi>Black Currans,</hi> as other are <hi>Red</hi> and <hi>White;</hi> but the <hi>White</hi> are called <hi>Gozell</hi> in ſome parts of <hi>Kent.</hi>

The conſtant uſe of the Powder of the the Leaves, and Seeds doth cure the <hi>Black Jaundiſe,</hi> being taken in wine, and the Seeds and Flowers being any wayes taken do much preſerve from the Gout and Stone. The <hi>Flowers</hi> being made into a <hi>Conſerve</hi> or <hi>preſerve</hi> with hony or Suggar, and eaten often, do much conſume the <hi>Kings-Evil.</hi> The diſtilled water of the Flowers, is profitable for the foreſaid purpoſes, helpeth <hi>ſurfets,</hi> and altereth the fits of <hi>Agues</hi> being taken with as much of the water of the leſſer <hi>Centaury,</hi> and the party laid to ſweat. It is moſt excellent to help the <hi>Kings-Evil,</hi> if one ounce of the water be taken morning and evening for a months ſpace, or longer, if need require.

It is effectuall alſo for the yellow Jaundiſe, and conſequently for the ſtoppings of the Liver, and to ſtay the Hicket, which is a diſtemper which happens not ſeldome to the mouth of the Stomack. It helpeth the Srangury and Stone in the Bladder, cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to moulder and paſſe away without any great pain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the uſe of it in women hindereth Conception, and is therefore to be avoided by them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire Children. If a dram of the duſt ſcraped from the Backſide of the Leaves be mixed with half a dram of Amber in powder, and taken with the juyce of Purſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane or Plantain, it will help the running of the Reines ſpeedily. It helpeth Melancholy diſeaſes alſo, and thoſe which riſe from the French diſeaſe, if the herb and root be boiled and taken: but they muſt not be boyled very long, for then the ſtrength will evaporare, eſpecially of the Leaves. The diſtilled water is good againſt the Stone both in the Reines and Bladder, and the Lye made of the Aſhes thereof, being drunk for ſometime together, helpeth Spleenetick perſons; for which purpoſe the herb may be boiled a little and applied warm to the Region of the Spleen.</p>

The Leaves drunk with Wine ſeven dayes, helpeth the yellow Jaundiſe, the obſtructions of the Liver and Kidneys, and is good againſt the <hi>Sciatica.</hi> It is a good medicine againſt the poyſons of all Serpents and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Beaſts, being taken in the manner aforeſaid, and being only ſtrewed or burnt in ſuch places, as are frequented with Vermine, it driveth them away with the ſmell thereof; and therefore it is not altogether inconvenient to ſet it in Flower-pots amongſt other things. <hi>Cluſius</hi> ſaith that in <hi>Spaine</hi> about <hi>Salaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> they uſe the decoction of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> kindes, to take away the Itch and Scabs in whomſoever have them, and he adviſeth that Caution be uſed in giving it; yet I ſuppoſe it is rather to be bathed with, then taken inwardly. But it is uſed more frequently with us, to be put amongſt other hot Herbs, either in Bathes, Oyntments, or other Medicines, to help thoſe that are burſten, or troubled with Cramps or Convulſions of Sinews, to provoke Urine, and bring down womens courſes, and generally it worketh the ſame effects, and may be applyed to all the diſeaſes that Southernwood is appropriated; and therefore I ſhall referre you to it, to be further informed concerning its Vertues, leſt I juſtly ſeeme

The fruit with the ſeed is good for the tremblings and paſſions of the heart, reſiſteth the danger that might happen by the ſting of Serpents, the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of venemous Creatures, or by poyſonfull Muſhromes; Being drunk in Wine, it helpeth a ſtinking breath, cureth the diſeaſes of the bladder, &amp; provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Urine: the ſame heated with wine, healeth all Ulcers that are hard to cure, and ſo it is good for blancs, wheales, and other breakings out of the skin: The decoction is good for Women, to ſit in or over that are troubled with the falling downe of the Mother, and is good alſo for the falling downe of the fundament, and the piles: Being mixed with Sallet-Oyle, or Oyle of Roſes and Wine, and applyed, it helpeth the ſwelling of the Cods, the Impoſtumes of the fundament and Saint Anthonies fire.

It is alſo mixed with thoſe things that are applyed to the Stomack to ſtay vomitings, and to ſtrengthen it, when it is grown weak, as alſo with thoſe things that ſtrengthen the Liver, to be uſed inwardly or outwardly: It is alſo available for clammy moiſt humours that fall upon the joynts or ſinews, thereby cauſing a weakneſſe and ſolution of the Nerves; Being uſed inwardly for the <hi>Piles</hi> it doth wonderfully help, for it dryeth, bindeth, and corroborateth the parts, It is alſo put into great <hi>Antidotes</hi> againſt Poyſon and the <hi>Peſtilence,</hi> not for any property it hath to reſiſt the venome, but to contemperate and ſtrengthen the Body. This is alſo a very good ſubſtitute for <hi>Acatia. Ledonum</hi> alſo drunk with old Wine, ſtayeth the Lask or Flux of the Belly, and eaſeth the griping pains thereof, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from ſharp and Chollerick humours, and is very good for all ſowre belchings, and provoketh Urine. It is very effectuall for the hardneſſe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſeaſes of the Mother, to eaſe the pains thereof, and to heal thoſe Ulcers that happen therein by taking of the fume thereof underneath, or applying the ſubſtance thereof in a Peſſary. Being made up with Storax and honey in a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hock or Electuary, it is very profitable for the cough of the Lungs, though it hath been of long continuance. If it be uſed in an Oyntment with Myrrhe, oyl of Myrtles, and Wine, it ſtayeth the falling of the hair. It helpeth alſo the pains in the eares, being uſed with ſome oyl of Roſes. Being diſſolved in Wine, and thoſe places waſhed therewith that have any ſcar or deformity thereon, it doth wonderfully alter the colour and evill ſight thereof, and maketh them to be well coloured again.

The decoction of the Bark of the Root or more uſually the decoction either freſh or dryed, performeth the like effects, and helpeth to eaſe the pains in the ſides, bowels and guts, that come by overmuch ſcowring or looſneſſe. The conſerve is alſo of very much uſe, and moſt familiarly taken for the purpoſes aforeſaid. The diſtilled water of the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſteeped one night in Sack, and drawne therefrom in a body of glaſſe, is a moſt certain and approved Remedy to eaſe all manner of gnawings in the Stomack, the ſides and bowels, or any griping pains in either of them, to drink a ſmall quantity when they are troubled therewith. Good ſtore of <hi>Sloes</hi> ſtamped and put into an earthen pot with new Ale, and ſo drunk, helpeth the pain of the breaſt, and the decoction of the Bark in water being, drunk, is good againſt piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in Bed. The Bark boyled in water till it be black and thick with Rye meal and Honey added thereunto, is available to conſume the dead fleſh which keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth wounds oftentimes from healing, and cureth the Cankers being applyed. The Leaves are good to make Lotions, to gargle and waſh the mouth and throat, as often as they are troubled with ſwellings, ſores, or Kernels, and to ſtay the diſtillations of Rhewme into the eyes, or other parts, as alſo to coole the heat and inflammation of them, and to eaſe hot pains of the Head, the Forehead and Temples being bathed therewith. The diſtilled water of the green Berries is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo uſed for the ſame effects, and ſo is the water that is diſtilled from the Flowers only. The Moſſe that groweth on the <hi>Black Thorn,</hi> draweth Prickles and Thorns out of the Fleſh, and this it may be ſaid to performe by the Signature which is repreſented by the Thornes growing on the Buſh.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52711:247"/> Face eſpecially under the eyes. The Leavs applyed to the Fore-head &amp; Temples qualifieth the Frenſy or Madneſſe by the cold and dry quality, which ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be in them, and the juyce of them put into the eares, killeth the worms in them.

It driveth away ſpiders, and other vermine, being laid for a ſtrewing, or burnt in ſuch places as they be frequent; It is ſaid that if a branch of Southernwood be laid under ones Bed, Pillow, or Bolſter, it provoketh carnall copulation, and reſiſteth all inchantments that hinder the ſame.</p>

It is alſo a preſent help for the riſing of the Mother procured by wind, the belly being fomented therewith, it provoketh Urine, and expelleth wind out of the ſtomack and bowels. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth a good appetite, by taking away that loathing from the Stomack, which hindreth the ſame: It cutteth tough phlegme in the Cheſt and Lunges, and helpeth to expectorate it the more eaſily, and therefore it is not without good reaſon uſed both for a farſing or faceting herb as they call it, and to ſeaſon ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed meat and broths, as I ſaid before; It quickneth the dull Spirits in the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy, the juyce thereof being ſnuffed or caſt up into the Noſtrhils: The juyce dropped into the eyes cleareth a dull ſight, if it proceed of thin cold humours diſtilling from the brain: The juyce heated with a little Oyl of Roſes, and dropped in the eares, cureth the noyſe and ſinging in them, and deafneſſe alſo: Applyed with Wheat Flower in the manner of a Pultis, it giveth eaſe to the <hi>Sciatica,</hi> or Members that have the Palſy, by heating and warming them.

Some uſe to put them into a Bag or Boulter, and ſhake them in the Sun, and ſometimes dry them in an Oven, and afterwards bring them to the Market, and ſell them to the Merchants, who direct them into all parts where they have good vent for them. The Crimſon Silke that is appointed in this Confection, is not to be that which is dyed after the ordinary manner, becauſe they uſe many things in the doing of it, which are not ſafe to be taken inwardly, and therefore ſome have uſed to draw a tincture out of the dryed Berries, but there is a ſafer courſe now deviſed, namely to ſteep the raw ſilke, that hath had no Art paſſe upon it, in the true Juice of the <hi>Chermes Berries,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imbibed and ſufficiently coloured, the Juice after boiling and ſtreining is fit to be uſed.

                  <p>The <hi>Birch Tree</hi> groweth in many places to be a goodly tall ſtreight tree, fraught with many boughs, &amp; other ſlender branches bending downwards, the elder being covered with a diſcoloured rough chapped barke, but thoſe that are younger, are browner by much, having under them another fine white thin rinde or barke. The <hi>Leaves</hi> at their firſt breaking out are crumpled, but afterwards they become ſomewhat ſmoother, not much unlike thoſe of the <hi>Beech-Tree,</hi> but ſmaller,
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:52711:290"/> and greener, with dents about the Edges: It beareth ſmall and ſhort <hi>Catkins,</hi> ſomewhat like to thoſe of the Haſel Nut tree, which abide on the branches a long time, wherein <hi>the ſeed</hi> is contained, but at length falls to the ground.</p>

The <hi>root</hi> is ſomewhat red, which having many ſmall threds faſtned unto it, taketh faſt hold of the earth, and creepeth a little way alſo; but that which maketh it moſt to increaſe is, that after the branches are weighed downe to the ground by the heavineſſe of the Flowers, it taketh root againe at the joynts thereof.</p>

And let them know alſo, that the preſent deſigne was not an</hi> univerſall Hiſtory <hi>of</hi> Plants, <hi>for then how voluminous muſt we needs have been? but onely of thoſe which are more uſefull, and may be gotten at the</hi> Apothecaries, <hi>or</hi> Druggiſts, <hi>if they grow not neer every ones habitation: Yet perhaps hereafter, if Life, Health, and Leiſure ſhall give way, I ſhall with a little</hi> encouragement <hi>deviſe ſome breef</hi> Appendix, <hi>wherein I ſhall compriſe the names at least, of all ſuch as are here wanting.
