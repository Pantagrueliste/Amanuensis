# Amanuensis 2.0 XML-Native Refactoring Summary

## Overview

We've completed a fundamental architectural refactoring of Amanuensis 2.0 to address its primary design flaw: the approach of extracting plain text from XML elements for processing. The new implementation works directly with XML nodes, preserving all structural information and relationships throughout the processing pipeline.

## Key Changes

1. **Completely Redesigned TEIProcessor**
   - Now preserves XML structure throughout the entire processing pipeline
   - Direct node manipulation instead of text extraction
   - Proper handling of element relationships and hierarchies
   - Special handling for different TEI abbreviation elements (`<abbr>`, `<g>`, `<am>`)
   - Uses XPath for element location instead of string matching

2. **Updated AbbreviationInfo Structure**
   - Now stores the XML element itself, not just its text representation
   - Maintains XPath expressions for precise element location
   - Provides normalized forms for dictionary lookups

3. **XML-Aware Expansion Logic**
   - Different handling for different types of abbreviation elements
   - Maintains proper TEI structure when adding expansions
   - Preserves attributes and element relationships

4. **Updated Suggestion Generation**
   - Now works with normalized element representations
   - No longer relies on context before/after (which was a text-based approach)
   - Uses the same dictionaries but with XML-aware lookups

5. **Improved User Interface**
   - Shows element types and XPath locations
   - Better displays of normalized forms used for lookups
   - Records decisions with more structural information

## Benefits of the New Architecture

1. **Structural Integrity**
   - No information loss during processing
   - Preserves all XML attributes, namespaces, and special elements

2. **Better TEI Compliance**
   - Follows TEI guidelines for abbreviation expansion
   - Properly handles complex abbreviation structures

3. **Improved Handling of Special Cases**
   - Correctly processes combining character abbreviations
   - Properly handles nested element structures

4. **More Reliable Element Location**
   - Uses XPath instead of string matching
   - Avoids issues with similar text appearing in multiple places

5. **Future Extensibility**
   - Easier to add support for additional TEI element types
   - Better foundation for handling other structured XML formats

## Next Steps

1. **Update Test Suite**
   - The existing tests need to be updated to work with the new implementation
   - Add specific tests for the XML-native processing features

2. **Documentation**
   - Document the new architecture in developer guides
   - Update user documentation to explain the XML-native approach

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile XML processing to identify bottlenecks
   - Add caching if needed for large documents

4. **Enhanced Visualization**
   - Improve the display of XML structure in the interactive interface
   - Add tree visualization for complex element relationships
